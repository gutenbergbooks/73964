<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>T</span>he</span> night lay clear upon the North Sea, but
now and then a soft wind came floating by; it
whistled through the rigging of a fishing smack
in which a little boy lay under a tarpaulin, peeping
over the side of the boat down into the
water below.</p>

<p>His father had told him to be still and to go
to sleep, so he lay looking up at the spangled
sky above, and the masts rocking to and fro
against the stars as the boat swayed about.
Sometimes he thought the tall, dark forms
looked like black arms trying to reach the
bright lamps and put them out. He did not
feel sleepy as he lay by himself and he began to wonder,
as he gazed into the water, how deep it was down
there, and whether the little fishes among the shells and
seaweeds were ever told by their fish-fathers to go to
sleep, and, if so, whether they found it as hard to do
as he did.</p>

<p>Presently he saw the eyes of a great shining fish
staring up at him. It opened its mouth as if it wished
to be friendly, but hardly knew how to begin, so the
little boy plucked up courage, though he had never
met a fish before and was not quite sure how to
address one.</p>

<p>“Is it very cold in the sea?” he inquired shyly.</p>

<p>“That depends on what you are accustomed to,”
replied the fish. “For my part, I should say it was
a particularly warm night for the time of year. What
in the world do you find to do in that monstrous boat?
Is there anything worth eating up there?”</p>

<p>“It’s very dull,” said the little boy. “My father
said I was to go to sleep, but I can’t. I’m not sleepy.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you come down here?” suggested the
fish. “It stands to reason that it must be much more
amusing in the water.”</p>

<p>“I should be drowned; I can’t swim like you.”</p>

<p>“How dreadfully ignorant,” remarked the fish.</p>

<p>The little boy was rather hurt at this, and made no
reply.</p>

<p>“Well,” continued the hoarse voice from below,
“if you like to come with me, I can show you some
of the most wonderful things in the world; you can
hold by my tail and I’ll pull you along. You can’t
drown so long as you don’t let go.”</p>

<p>The little boy was much tempted.</p>

<p>“But are you sure you won’t leave me?” he asked
anxiously.</p>

<p>“Goodness, no,” replied the fish, “I’ll see that no
harm comes to you. You are evidently a shockingly
ignorant child, and it would be real charity to show
you something of the world. Come along and don’t
be silly.”</p>

<p>The little boy looked round to see that there was
no one near, then he slipped over the side and, in
another minute, was in the sea and holding firmly to
the tail of his new acquaintance.</p>

<p>Away they shot through the clear water; it was not
nearly so cold as it had looked, and the rapid motion
was very exciting.</p>

<p>On they flew, smoothly and easily; they passed tall
ships and curiously-shaped masses of rock sticking up
out of the sea. Great twisted pieces of sea-weed
floated by them, and the flashing lights of Orion’s Belt
seemed suspended from the dark blue arch overhead,
while, up in the north, the Northern Lights shot
their trembling streamers far into the centre of the sky.</p>

<p>By the time day was dawning they had reached a
tract of ocean where there was neither sail nor coast,
and where the rolling line of water stretched for miles
around.</p>

<p>“Now,” said the fish, “I will show you one of the
strangest things in the world. Can you see anything
between us and the horizon?”</p>

<p>“I see a dark spot a long way off.”</p>

<p>The light was growing brighter every moment, and
pale streaks in the sky began to kindle the sea when
the fish and his companion drew near the object of
which they had been speaking. In the midst of the
heaving water there rose a steep rock; on its grim
sides grew neither sea-weed nor anything to give sign
of life. There was an oppressive silence hanging
over everything, and the water lay dark and still;
no little wave played against the relentless stone.
On the top of this rock a beautiful woman sat with
her hands clasped together. She wore a black robe
against which her arms shone like ivory, and her
hair flowed in a shower over her shoulders. Now
and then she raised her eyes and looked out to sea;
they wandered over the horizon and rested with a look
of sad expectation upon it, then she sighed and glanced
down at something which she held in her hand.</p>

<p>Beside her stood the only living creature excepting
herself visible on that desolate place—a gigantic grey
cormorant of terrible aspect and size. A gleam of light
from the rising sun shot over the waters, and, as it
touched the woman’s hair with its first rays, the cormorant
flew up into the air. From some hidden place in the
rock another bird appeared, and, joining its mate, rose
with him far above their bleak abode; then the two
sailed away and were soon lost in the distance.</p>

<p>“What does it all mean? Oh, do tell me!” begged
the little boy.</p>

<p>“I thought I could show you something surprising,”
chuckled the fish; “this is the history of it. I am
one of the <span class='it'>very few</span> who know anything about it.
Inside that rock, in a cavern which is reached by a
passage to which no one knows the entrance, sits an
old witch; she is very wicked, and is sometimes able
to cast dreadful spells upon her enemies. That Princess
who sits there is the daughter of a King, whose
country is an immense way off, and who once had
the ill-luck to offend the old woman. So, when the
Princess was a child, she went to the King’s palace and
stole her away; here she has kept her sitting, year after
year, upon this lonely rock with no one to speak to
but the old cormorant. Every day he keeps guard in
case someone should come to take her away, and every
morning he flies off to fish with his mate, who has a
nest just now and young ones in a cave of the rock.
Once in two days the hag comes out to bring the
Princess food and to ask her whether she sees anyone
coming, and when she gets no reply, she laughs and
leaves her again.”</p>

<p>“Will she ever get away?” asked the little boy.</p>

<p>“How can I tell?” said the fish. “She has sat
there for so long that it doesn’t seem like it. There
is only one chance that I can see. She holds in her
hand a little heart made of gold; if she could only
find someone to whom she could give it, she might be
saved. For, whoever possesses it can ask any question,
and the heart will answer and tell its owner how to act
under all difficulties. But he who takes it has to
accept trouble and pain with the gift.”</p>

<p>“But then, why doesn’t she ask it herself how to
get away?”</p>

<p>“The heart is of no use to any one but a man,” said
the fish.</p>

<p>“And I suppose no man has ever been here?”</p>

<p>“Two or three have come sailing by; one who
came was anxious to help the Princess, but, as she was
about to throw him the Golden Heart, she told him
that if he took it he would have to face as much
trouble as a man could bear. So he would not have
it and sailed away. But that was years ago—and now,
we really can’t stay here any longer, nor do any good
if we do—let us be off.”</p>

<p>And he swam away.</p>

<p>The little boy would have liked to stay and speak
to the Princess and his eyes were full of tears.</p>

<p>“What are you sniffling at behind there?” exclaimed
the fish, who was getting rather tired of his
load.</p>

<p>“I am so sorry for her!” he sobbed.</p>

<p>“Dear! Dear! If you cry for all the troubles
you see, you will have enough to do; try to think of
something else, and, for goodness’ sake, strike out a
little with your legs and help me along—I have to do
all the work.”</p>

<p>The little boy was so frightened when he heard this
that he kicked out with might and main for fear that
his protector should shake him off.</p>

<p>When evening was coming on and when they had
travelled some distance, they saw a large ship; as she
approached, the fish suggested that they should swim
alongside, and the little boy was charmed with the
idea. They saw that the sails were embroidered with
gold and silver, and that, on the prow, there was an
immense carved crown glittering with precious stones.
Closer and closer she came till they were almost
touching her. A man was looking over the bulwark
into the water; he was young and very richly dressed,
and a sword hung at his side. Over his face was a
black mask which hid it completely, leaving only the
mouth visible.</p>

<p>“There!” remarked the fish, “look at that man.
That is another wonderful sight. He is young and
rich and a king’s son, but he chooses to sail about by
himself. He is so ugly that he wears a mask day and
night and never takes it off, and he roams about on
the high seas so that he need see none but his own
crew who love him so much that they would go with
him anywhere.”</p>

<p>“What a pity,” said the little boy, wondering.
“He looks very nice standing up there with those
beautiful clothes on. And I can see his mouth; it
does not look so very ugly.”</p>

<p>“It’s simply enormous,” replied the fish.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t think so—really,” answered the little
boy, “it isn’t any bigger than yours, you know.”</p>

<p>“That’s neither here nor there,” said the fish; “and
don’t pull my tail so. You hold it so clumsily that I
can hardly move.”</p>

<p>“I wish I could see him nearer,” continued the little
boy, lost in admiration of the figure above him, “I’ve
never seen any one like him.”</p>

<p>“You haven’t seen much,” answered the fish, who
had not been best pleased by the allusion to his mouth,
“now come along.”</p>

<p>“Oh, wait a minute, do, please! He’s looking
at us.”</p>

<p>The Prince was gazing over the bulwark at them.</p>

<p>“Well!” exclaimed the fish, “if you’re so devoted
to him you had better stay with him altogether. I’m
getting sick of dragging you along like this.”</p>

<p>The poor little boy was horrified and looked imploringly
up at the Prince, who called one of his men
to see the strange pair. “Lower a boat and fetch me
that child,” he said, “and the fish too, if you can.”</p>

<p>When the fish heard this, he began to flounder so
violently that he twitched his tail free and swam quickly
off, leaving his friend gasping in the waves. The
Prince threw off his beautiful coat, plunged into
the sea and caught the struggling figure, holding
it till the boat picked them both up. Soon they
stood safe on deck, dripping with salt water, the
little boy sobbing with terror and excitement. “Oh,”
he cried, “look! look! your lovely clothes are all
spoilt.”</p>

<p>“Never mind, little man, never mind,” laughed the
Ugly Prince, “and don’t cry. You are quite safe
with me and I have plenty of other clothes in my
cabin.”</p>

<p>Then he sent for a great tall sailor, who took the
little boy below, where he was undressed and dried,
then rolled up in one of the Prince’s cloaks and carried
on deck. “Come here,” said the Prince, “and tell me
all about yourself.”</p>

<p>The child came up shyly and climbed upon his knee.
“And how was it,” continued he, “that you
came to be swimming about with that great fish?
Little boys don’t travel in that sort of way as a
rule.”</p>

<p>His voice was so soft and he stroked the child’s
hair so kindly, that the little fellow began to think he
was a much nicer friend to have than the fish, with
all its knowledge; so he told him of everything that
had happened and especially of the marvellous sights
he had seen since he slipped over the side of his father’s
smack a day ago. When he had finished there was
a long silence and he glanced up at the Prince, for he
felt, somehow, that he was looking grave. But the
black mask hid everything.</p>

<p>In a short time the Ugly Prince set him down and
spoke a few words to his helmsman. Then the ship
turned slowly round and sailed off in the direction
from which the fish had come.</p>

<p>As night drew on they still kept steadily forward,
and when the stars had come out and the last light
departed, the little boy was put to bed in a beautiful
cabin all painted sea-green, with a pale green curtain
hanging over the door on which was embroidered a
silver crescent moon. He was laid in a soft bed with
a quilt of the same colour, and soon he was far away
in the land of dreams, dreaming that he was again in
the sea, sinking into a world of branching sea-weed and
silver sand through which swam the little fishes about
which he had so often wondered.</p>

<p>When he opened his eyes next morning the light
was peeping in through the port-hole, and his clothes,
which had been dried, were lying beside a bath which
was waiting for him. He washed and dressed and
then went on deck, where the Ugly Prince stood
looking out over the ship’s bows. When he saw the
child he lifted him up in his arms.</p>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<p><span class='pageno' title='10' id='Page_10'></span></p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/010.jpg' alt='fancy sailing ship on the ocean' id='iid-0002' style='width:80%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<p>“Oh!” cried the little boy. “I see a dark thing
far away in front! Why, it is the rock where the
Princess is! Are we going there?”</p>

<p>The Prince did not answer.</p>

<p>As the sun rose out of the ocean a short time later,
the vessel was drawing very near to the rock which
rose, like some dark monster, out of the sea, and the
Prince and the little boy were on deck, the latter looking
eagerly out for the captive Princess.</p>

<p>There she sat, just as she had sat the day before and
all those weary days in the years gone by with her
hands clasped over her one hope, the Golden Heart.
Two dark spots could be seen in the distant sky
growing smaller and smaller; they were the two
cormorants flying off for food.</p>

<p>As the Princess saw the ship the colour rushed back
into her pale cheeks; she fixed her eyes on the advancing
sails, and at last distinguished the tall form
of the Ugly Prince standing out against the sea and
sky beyond. As the vessel came under the shadow
of the rock he looked up at the sweet face above
him and told her to have courage, and that he had
come to take her from her long imprisonment, back
to the world she had left.</p>

<p>“Throw me,” he said, “the Golden Heart that you
hold.”</p>

<p>The Princess stood up. “Thank Heaven that the
cormorant is gone!” she cried. “He stands there so
that, if I throw it to anyone, he may catch it in his
beak and rob me of my last chance.”</p>

<p>“But throw it carefully,” begged the little boy, “or
the Prince won’t catch it.”</p>

<p>The Prince smiled. “Now,” he called.</p>

<p>“But, before I do so,” said the Princess, “I must
tell you this; if you take it, it will bring you pain and
sorrow—perhaps more than you can bear. Can you
really accept it? Are you willing to take the trouble
that must come?”</p>

<p>The Ugly Prince simply held out his hands.
“Throw,” he said.</p>

<p>The little boy thought he had never seen anybody
look so noble as he did, standing there with his outstretched
hands and his masked face turned up to the
lovely, sad figure above him.</p>

<p>A flash pierced the air, and the Heart lay safe in the
hands of the Ugly Prince.</p>

<p>“And now,” he said as he held it, “remember that
there is nothing I will not do for your sake; whatever
this thing tells me to do, that will I do; wherever
it tells me to go, there will I go; and, as long as there
is life in me, I will not rest until I have accomplished
my end.”</p>

<p>The evil birds were now seen returning over the
waters, and at the sight of the ship lying anchored
under the rock, they were dreadfully disturbed, and
made such a flapping of wings that the witch came up
from her lair to see what could be the matter. When
she saw the vessel her fury knew no bounds, and when
she observed that the Golden Heart was gone, she
nearly wrung the old cormorant’s neck.</p>

<p>“The next time you go away,” she cried, “I will sit
here and watch myself! And, as for you,” she went
on, turning to the Princess, “you need never think you
can escape, for you shall be guarded day and night!”</p>

<p>But the Princess said nothing.</p>

<p>Meantime, the Ugly Prince was taking counsel of
his treasure; he looked long and curiously at it; then,
as he felt a little tremor fluttering between his palms,
he inquired of it what he was to do to save the
Princess from her bondage. A radiance like a flame
rose all round the Heart, and a small, soft voice spoke.
It was so low that he had to bend down his head to
catch the words. “To-night,” it said, “you must
watch on deck until morning, and when the two
cormorants fly away at sunrise, be careful to notice from
which part of the rock the female bird comes; then,
when they have started on their flight, slip down into
the water and swim to the place. It is a large cave,
black and gloomy, but, nevertheless, swim in. The
water is deep at the entrance, but when you have gone
forward a few strokes, you will find a great stone rising
a couple of feet above its level; let your eyes get
accustomed to the darkness and you will see upon the
top of this stone the cormorant’s nest. Climb to it
very softly, for in it will be the three little cormorants
asleep. Be sure you do not wake them. Beside them
you will find three grey feathers which you must take;
the first feather will give you the power of becoming
invisible when you please, the second will enable you to
see in the dark, and the third will enable you to understand
the language of birds. When you have secured
them, make yourself invisible and stay in the cavern
until the mother-bird comes home. Then, keep your
ears open to hear all that passes.”</p>

<p>The voice ceased, and the Prince, knowing he would
be told no more, buttoned the Golden Heart into his
doublet and prepared to wait patiently till night should
come and he could take up his post on deck to watch
for the coming sunrise.</p>

<p>The hours wore on and day slowly faded. When
the dark set in he lay down, with his eyes fixed on the
heavens, hardly able to bear the time which lay
between him and the morning, and, when dawn came
creeping on, he distinguished the dim figure of the old
cormorant at his post.</p>

<p>He stood as though carved out of the stone beneath
him until the sun’s disc appeared over the horizon-line,
when, with a loud flapping, he rose in the air. The
Ugly Prince lay looking at the rock as though his life
depended upon it, and, from out of a deep shadow in
the right side of the huge mass, the mother-bird came
flying to join her mate. He kept his eyes on the spot
till the last rush of wings had died upon the air, then
he looked up at the Princess and plunged into the sea.</p>

<p>The green water had a cold chill which struck him
to the marrow, but he swam steadily on, stroke after
stroke, till he reached the mouth of a rugged cavern
where the rock towered above his head as though
poised for a moment ere it fell to crush him to atoms;
and, through the darkness, he saw the outline of the
flat-topped stone described by the Golden Heart.</p>

<p>With long strokes he swam to it, and, clinging to its
jagged sides, drew himself out of the water. To climb
to the top was the work of a moment. Once there, he
stood staring through the gloom at the nest, which was
built, as he had been told, on the summit. There lay
the three little cormorants asleep, like three fluffy balls;
he could just distinguish their soft bodies and their
breasts heaving up and down in the deep breathing of
their slumbers. Not a sound was to be heard but the
lapping of the water, stirred by his swimming as it rose
and fell against the stone’s foot. As his eyes became
more accustomed to the darkness he saw, beside the
sleeping birds, the three feathers for which he was
searching. He put in his hand and took them, his
heart beating high as he felt all three in his grasp and
knew that the first step of his labours was accomplished.
He slid down again into the salt water, having placed
his new treasures carefully in his pocket. Then he
seated himself in a little niche above water-mark to
await the mother-bird, wishing with all his might for
the promised power of seeing in the dark. Immediately
every cranny in the cave became visible and he began
to wonder where the mysterious passage might be
which led to the witch’s dwelling.</p>

<p>In a short time the narrow slit of light was darkened
by the form of the cormorant-mother coming back to
the nest; she flew in and alighted by the side of her
young ones. The Prince lost no time in wishing for
the power of understanding bird-language, and, as the
little birds awoke, he strained every nerve to catch any
speech which might pass between the four creatures.</p>

<p>“Lie still, you tiresome little things,” said the
mother as they all began chattering at once, “I have
got some very good fish here; but <span class='it'>not one</span> of you shall
taste a bit if you make such a noise.”</p>

<p>“What a long time you’ve been getting it,” squeaked
one of the little birds.</p>

<p>“That is not the way to speak,” observed the mother,
“and you must learn not to make remarks when you
are not spoken to. If your father heard you talking
like that he would punish you severely. I am always
very quick about getting your food, and greediness is a
very shocking fault—remember that.”</p>

<p>“But I’m not greedy, I’m hungry.”</p>

<p>“Be silent, sir, at once!”</p>

<p>The three little birds were very much frightened at
this and kept quiet while the fish were being broken
up and divided into four parts. When this was done
a great gobbling began, and no one spoke for some
time.</p>

<p>“Now,” said the old bird, when every piece had
disappeared. “I am going to speak to you very
seriously.”</p>

<p>At this there was a dead silence, for all the little birds
felt that their mother was in no humour to be trifled
with this morning.</p>

<p>“Remember that I forbid you all distinctly to make
any noise to-day or to scream or chatter loudly. I
have a very good reason for doing so, and as I wish you
to see for yourselves how very important it is, I will
tell you about it. Are you all listening?”</p>

<p>“Yes! Yes!” cried the little birds.</p>

<p>“Your father is in great trouble,” she began, “for a
most disagreeable thing has happened and our mistress
is very angry. A ship is close by and there is a strange
man on board who wears a black mask. We are afraid
that he has come to take the Princess away. Yesterday,
on our return from fishing, we found the ship here,
and, what was far worse, discovered that the Heart
which the Princess held in her hand had gone. Your
father thinks there is every reason to believe that the
man with the black mask has got it and he is much
distressed, for our mistress has used words to him which
have hurt his feelings deeply. Now, if any of you
scream and make a noise, it may draw the attention of
that wicked man in the ship to this place and he may
discover the way to our mistress’s cave, which lies, as
I suppose you all know, behind that piece of rock
shaped like a fish’s head sticking out in yonder corner.
If he got to her he might do her some mischief, or
perhaps force her to give him the Princess. Besides
which, he would certainly wring all your necks—and
then, how would you like <span class='it'>that</span>?”</p>

<p>Here one of the little birds began to cry.</p>

<p>“How dare you make that noise!” said his mother,
prodding him with her beak. “Stop crying instantly,
sir, or we may all be lost!”</p>

<p>The squeaking soon ceased and, quiet being restored,
one of the little birds, being of an argumentative turn of
mind, began to ask questions. “But if that dreadful
man got to our mistress,” he inquired, “how could he
find his way to the Princess afterwards?”</p>

<p>“If he were in the cave he might see how our
mistress goes to her; you know, she takes off her left
shoe and knocks at the wall with it. Then she says:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“ ‘Left-foot shoe, left-foot shoe,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Open, rock, and I’ll pass through.’</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>And the rock opens in a straight passage and she goes
up to the top of it, right outside to where your father
and the Princess sit. Now, I’ve told you enough—be
quiet.”</p>

<p>All this time the Ugly Prince was looking for the
stone like a fish’s head, and soon saw it sticking out
in the remotest part of the cavern, so he began climbing
towards it. It was weary work, for the cold had
made his limbs stiff, and he feared to go quickly in
case any sound should attract the old bird’s attention.
With much trouble he reached the place, and, looking
behind the fish’s head, saw an opening which seemed
much too small for a human being to enter. He
determined, however, to try what he could do and
began to creep in, finding that he could just push himself
along, and although he could see no light at the
other end, he pressed forward. A horrible sickening
sensation came over him when he had gone some way,
and he felt as though he should be suffocated in this
stifling place, from which none could deliver him, and
which his crew, if they began to search for him, could
never find. The air grew so close and the tunnel so
narrow that he had almost given up all hope of life
when his head struck against the rock and he lay half
stunned. “Now,” he thought, “all is really lost, for
I can get no further, and must die in this loathsome
place.”</p>

<p>As he lay in his cramped position he saw what
seemed to be a white pebble embedded in the rock
somewhere on his left. He stretched out his hand
with great difficulty, and found that it came in contact
with nothing solid, though it hid the white spot from
his view, and he realised that the object was not a
pebble at all, but a speck of light in the far distance,
and that he was groping with his arm down a narrow
passage, starting away at right angles from the place in
which he was imprisoned. A new hope sprang up in
his heart, and he dragged himself round the corner.
The tunnel grew a little wider, and, with every few
inches that he moved forward, his courage rose, and
the outer air grew nearer. The stones tore his hands,
and he was bruised in every limb as he crept along, but
he pressed on till the light became larger and yellower
and the air less oppressive, and, at last, after many
struggles, he stood upright outside the tunnel’s
mouth.</p>

<p>An enormous hall met his eyes; bare rock formed
its walls and ceiling and the ground under his feet was
covered with fine sand.</p>

<p>From the sides of this place hung twisted shapes.
He could hardly see what they were. First he thought
that they must be great ropes of sea-weed, then human
forms; grinning faces seemed to start from them at
every side, and yet he could never really make out
that they were the forms of either men or beasts, for,
as each thing appeared to take some definite shape,
it would speedily turn into something else, like the
wild and fleeting images in a dream.</p>

<p>As he stood, the noise of the sea roaring underground
in remote hollows of the rocks smote desolately
on his ear, and, for a moment, the dreary sound made
his heart sink in his body. But he thought of the
Princess, and courage leaped up in his soul.</p>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<p><span class='pageno' title='20' id='Page_20'></span></p>

<div class='figcenter'>

</div>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<p>A column of stone, reaching to the roof, stood in
the middle of the cave, and, at its foot, was a thing
which looked like a human figure lying by a fire. He
approached, thanking Heaven for the power of becoming
invisible, and saw that he was in the presence
of the witch. By a happy chance she had overslept
herself, and had not yet gone up to the Princess.</p>

<p>As he looked there was a stir in her recumbent form.
She rose, and, drawing off her left shoe, approached
the wall.</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“Left-foot shoe, left-foot shoe,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;Open, rock, and I’ll pass through,”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>she muttered, striking it. Then the wall cracked open
and she gathered her skirt more closely round her and
disappeared through the opening, which closed behind
her.</p>

<p>He paced up and down, straining his ears to catch
any sound that might steal through some chink in the
rock, and give him an idea of what was going on above.
But no sound came.</p>

<p>At last the wall opened and his enemy appeared.
An evil smile was on her face, and he guessed that she
had been taunting her victim. His blood boiled.
When the chasm closed, the hag, instead of replacing
her shoe, drew off its fellow and, putting them both in
a corner, flung herself down by the fire. The Prince
had not expected such luck and he bounded towards
them. At this she looked up quickly; he had forgotten,
in his excitement, that, though invisible, his
movements could be heard, and for a minute he stood
waiting to see if she would notice the footprints he
had made in the sand. But after sitting erect to listen,
she seemed re-assured and lay down, while he, pausing
a little space ere he moved again, heard her breathing
grow heavier and saw that she was falling asleep again
over her fire. Then he picked up her left shoe.</p>

<p>He advanced to the wall and struck it, saying the
words he had heard her use.</p>

<p>It flew open before him and the fresh air rushed
against his face. With one backward glance at the
sleeper he climbed the incline, and, in a moment, had
wished himself visible again and was standing on the
rock by the Princess.</p>

<p>Her eyes were fixed on his ship, but she turned on
hearing a step. Her face was almost fierce, for she
expected nothing better than to meet the witch. Then
she saw the Ugly Prince and rose, with a cry, stretching
out her hand to him. Her great sorrow seemed to be
looking out of her eyes, and the beauty of her face
was so far beyond anything he had imagined that he
stood before her dumbfounded, more like a culprit than
the man who had fought his way to her through peril
and fatigue. He took her hand and pressed his lips
upon it. As he did so there was a rushing in the air,
and the old cormorant, who had just returned from his
fishing, began raining the blows of his heavy wings
upon his shoulders. He fought it off as well as he
could with his left arm while he drew his sword, and,
as the savage bird swung back to make a fresh swoop,
the steel blade flashed and it fell dead on the rock at his
feet.</p>

<p>The Princess covered her eyes; she almost sank upon
the ground, but the Ugly Prince caught her in his
arms.</p>

<p>“How can we escape? How are we to reach the
ship?” she cried.</p>

<p>He drew out the Golden Heart. The same tremor
ran through it as it said: “Cut off the cormorant’s
wings and strike them with the witch’s shoe. They
will fasten themselves upon your shoulders and you will
be able to fly as well as the bird.”</p>

<p>The Prince obeyed, then he stood ready to leave for
ever the scene of his conflict. “Come,” he said to the
Princess.</p>

<p>We must now return to the little boy, who had never
left the deck all the hours his friend had been away.
As he saw him rise into the air with his living burden
he clasped his hands, standing breathless until the
cormorant’s wings had borne him over the strip of
water. His joy knew no bounds as he saw him land
safely beside him, and he looked with admiration and
awe upon the lovely Princess who had suffered so
much.</p>

<p>“Who is this?” she asked, pointing to the child.</p>

<p>“That is more than I can tell you,” said the Prince,
smiling, “for I picked him out of the water. But he
is very dear to me all the same.”</p>

<p>“Shall I love you too?” she said, looking down at
him with her sweet, mysterious eyes. “I have had no
one to love for so very long.”</p>

<p>The Golden Heart was their guide, for it knew
everything—even the way over the trackless seas—and
soon the terrible rock was no more than a fast
disappearing speck, far astern.</p>

<p>After a happy voyage they reached the country
where the Princess’s father still reigned, an old man
bowed down by grief.</p>

<p>When they got to the shore and the people saw that
it was their own Princess who had returned and heard
the tale of her captivity and rescue, their joy knew no
bounds and they conducted the Ugly Prince and his
crew with great rejoicings to the royal palace, which
lay at some distance off. Messengers were sent forward
to the poor old King, who, in spite of age and infirmity,
mounted his horse for the first time for many
years and came out to meet them.</p>

<p>He could hardly believe the news, and, when the
meeting was over and he had held his daughter in his
arms and knew that it was no dream, but the real,
happy truth, he turned to the Prince. “I cannot
speak to you now,” he said, “but to-morrow you must
tell me the story with your own lips, and, were you to
ask me for my kingdom, it should be yours.”</p>

<p>The next morning the Ugly Prince was summoned
to the old man’s presence. He told the story of the
Princess’s rescue, making very light of his own brave
deeds, but the King was not easily deceived; and, as he
sent also for the little boy, he soon got at the whole
truth.</p>

<p>“And now,” he said, at the end of the tale, “is
there anything in the wide world that I can do for
you? My kingdom and all I have is yours if you will
only take it. Have you no wish—no matter what it
may be—that I can gratify?”</p>

<p>“I have loved your daughter since the first moment
that I saw her,” said the Ugly Prince.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p>One evening the Ugly Prince and the Princess were
walking on the terrace of the palace garden. The
sunset glowed along the western sky, the birds were
twittering in the deepening silence, and the heavy scent
of masses of roses which climbed over balconies and
pillars steeped the air. A minstrel was singing softly
inside one of the open windows, and his song reached
them as they stood looking out over the balustrade
on to the country lying spread before them.</p>

<p>“Do you remember,” said the Prince, “that, when
you threw me the Golden Heart, you told me I should
have to suffer almost more trouble than I could
bear?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she answered.</p>

<p>“Well,” continued he, “I nearly gave myself up for
lost in the tunnel of rock; but, after all, I came safely
through it. And it was a small price to pay for this,”
he added, taking her hand.</p>

<p>“How brave you are!” said she.</p>

<p>He laughed. “But now,” he said, “I cannot
imagine anything happier than the present. I have no
wish unfulfilled but one, and that is to make you my
wife, which I shall do in a few days.”</p>

<p>The Princess looked down. “I have one wish
ungratified,” she replied.</p>

<p>“But you have only to say it,” exclaimed he;
“surely you know I would do anything for you—anything.
I promise it.”</p>

<p>“I can hardly ask you. It would seem as though I
did not trust you. It troubles me very much,” she
said, with tears in her eyes.</p>

<p>“Do not keep anything from me,” he implored.
“I cannot be content now until I know what it is.
You shall not go from here until you tell me.”</p>

<p>“If you would, only once, before our wedding-day,
let me see your face.”</p>

<p>The Prince groaned.</p>

<p>“But you promised,” urged the Princess.</p>

<p>For a moment he hesitated, then he turned away
and took off the black mask. When he faced her again
a shriek rang over the garden and she fell senseless.</p>

<p>He had just time to replace it before the King,
alarmed by the sound, came out followed by several
servants. The Princess was carried into the palace and
laid upon a couch, and, when many restoratives had
been administered, she opened her eyes; but, on seeing
her lover, an expression of terror came into her face
and she fainted again.</p>

<p>The Prince withdrew, asking the King to go with
him. When the old man heard what had happened,
he wrung his hands and begged him to refrain from
seeing his daughter until the next morning; then he
returned to her bedside, saying that he would come
back on the following day and give him news of her.</p>

<p>The Ugly Prince spent most of the night in walking
up and down his room; the little boy, who had come
to him as soon as he knew what had happened, did all
he could to comfort him, and, at last, the unhappy
lover fell into a heavy sleep with his hand clasped in
that of the child, who refused to leave him, and who
sat watching with his friend until he, too, became
drowsy and lost consciousness.</p>

<p>It was almost noon when they were aroused by
the sound of footsteps, and, looking up, saw the
King.</p>

<p>“My son,” he said to the Prince, “I have come
with weary tidings; my daughter has recovered; but
early this morning she sent to me.”</p>

<p>He paused for a moment, and went on in a shaking
voice.</p>

<p>“She implores you to release her from her promise
to marry you. She will give no reason for what she
asks, and when I suggested that she should speak to
you herself, she grew so pale that I feared she would
faint again. I reasoned with her, I prayed her
to consider her words again, but all to no effect. I
knew not how to act. She owes her very life to you.
I would compel her to fulfil her promise if I could
force myself to do so, but alas! alas! I cannot when I
see her in such a state!”</p>

<p>The Prince was standing before the weeping old
man. “And do you think I would accept such a
sacrifice?” he said, slowly.</p>

<p>The King made no reply, but covered his face.
There was a long silence.</p>

<p>Then the Ugly Prince spoke, and his voice seemed
to the little boy as though it were miles away.</p>

<p>“Sire,” he said, “tell the Princess that my only
wish is to serve her. I release her from this moment.”</p>

<p>Then the King went slowly away, and, as the curtain
fell behind him, the Ugly Prince was left alone with
the little boy.</p>

<p>He remembered what the Princess had told him
when he took the Heart from her, and he knew that
the time had come.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p>When the King’s subjects heard that the marriage
was not to be, they were sorely troubled, and gloom
fell over the Palace. The King refused to be comforted,
and, when the Prince announced his coming
departure, he begged for a last interview before he left.</p>

<p>“What you have told me about the Golden Heart
is very wonderful,” he said. “Could it be of no use
now?”</p>

<p>“Nothing can be of any use,” sighed the Prince.
“It cannot alter my face.”</p>

<p>“But it seems to work miracles,” persisted the old
man, “and one cannot tell how far its powers may
extend.”</p>

<p>So they consulted the Golden Heart.</p>

<p>“There is,” said the voice, “in a far country beyond
a vast desert, almost impossible to cross, a marsh
traversed by a stream. On the further bank of that
stream, at a place where rises a tall crag like the
entrance to a tomb, there grows a plant bearing a
cluster of pale red berries. It only shows itself once
in a thousand years, and on this day three months the
time for it to appear will be due. You must reach the
place on the evening before its appearance, and allow
nothing to tempt you from the spot, for it grows up in
one night, and lasts but a few hours. When it has
grown as high as your knee, break off the spike of
berries, crush them in your hands, and anoint your
face with the juice. It has the power of restoring
perfect beauty, as well as perfect health, and it can
only benefit one person in a thousand years. Hardly
any one in the world has heard of its existence. You
must start at once, as the way is long, and you must
go by the Great Gates, which are at the other side of
the world, and which lead to the desert.”</p>

<p>That evening the Ugly Prince set out. He took
with him the witch’s shoe, and the old cormorant’s
wings hung at his saddle; he also placed the three
feathers in his cap. Before he went he called the little boy.</p>

<p>“I am going on a long journey,” he said, “and it
will be many months before I can return; you must be
very good until I come back. Stay here with the
Princess. If I never come back the King has promised
that this palace shall be your home. And now, my
dear little child, my faithful friend, good-bye, for I must
go. Good-bye. You will not forget me?”</p>

<p>The little boy clung round his neck till the servants
came to tell the Prince that his horse was saddled;
then he rushed up to the highest tower of the Palace,
and, leaning far out of the window, watched the
gallant figure riding away, as it seemed to him, into the
sunset.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p>It was in the eleventh week after his departure that
the Ugly Prince drew near the Great Gates that lie at the
other side of the world. He had only one week left in
which to cross the desert beyond them, and he saw, on
approaching, that they were locked; he had not
counted on such a possibility, and it was with a heavy
heart that he marked how strong they were, and how
they towered in the air above him. As he dismounted
to lead his horse nearer—for the animal looked with
terrified eyes upon the huge bars through which the
wind was humming and vibrating—something fell from
the saddle. It was the witch’s shoe. He picked it
up and ran to the Gates, striking the lock and saying:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“Left-foot shoe, left-foot shoe,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;Open, Gates, and I’ll go through.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p>They burst open, and he turned to re-mount his
horse. But the creature stood with planted fore-feet
and quivering nostrils, and he saw that there was no
time in which to urge him forward, as the Gates were
closing again. He tore the cormorant’s wings from
where they hung on the saddle, together with his few
provisions and a water-flask, and was just in time to
rush through them before they swung together with a
crash that rang through the air like thunder, and sent
the frightened horse tearing over the plain. Then he
stood unhorsed and alone on the confines of the
desert.</p>

<p>His only chance now lay in making use of the
cormorant’s wings, which he had hitherto omitted to
do, preferring to travel on horseback. But he fastened
them to his shoulders by the power of the magic shoe
and toiled on, directed by the Golden Heart, going
straight forward until his provisions were nearly done.
One morning he reached a green oasis on which rose
a fountain, bubbling in a grove of feathery acacia
trees, and, as he lay resting in the shade, he saw two
birds sitting among the boughs and talking together.
Remembering the feathers in his cap, he wished to be
invisible and to understand their language.</p>

<p>“Look at that cool water,” said one. “When we
have arranged our wings and tails a little after our
flight, we will go down and drink. We shall not
get a chance again till we reach the stream flowing
through the marsh land for which we are bound.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” replied the other, “and, after that, we
will start at once, for I am anxious to get home. I
have not seen my family for an age, and I think it is
really time I put in an appearance. We can be there
by nightfall.”</p>

<p>When the Prince heard this he resolved to follow
them; and when the two birds had satisfied their thirst
and set off on their journey, he spread his wings and
sailed with rapid strokes after them.</p>

<p>“What an odd rushing there is in the air beside us,”
observed one; “the wind must be going to change.”</p>

<p>By the time it was dark they entered the marsh land
and saw a glimmer of the stream for which the Prince
was looking. In due time they flew across it, and he
alighted on the further bank and dropped his wings
while he sat down to rest. His hopes were high as he
thought of his lost Princess—lost perhaps no longer—and
he anticipated the moment of finding the plant
with joy almost amounting to dread. He rose to his
feet and wished for the power of seeing in the dark.</p>

<p>He saw that he stood in the midst of so wonderful a
piece of scenery that he could hardly believe himself
awake. Just in front of him appeared the rock which
the Golden Heart had described as being like the
entrance to a tomb. It rose upwards out of a deep,
dark pool, and a great star which stood in silver
radiance over the summit threw a long steel-blue
reflection trailing across the silent water. Down the
face of the rock, and all round on a tangle of low
bushes which closed him in on every side, hung thick
wreaths of white convolvulus; strange lights flashed in
and out among the heavy foliage, and from the blossoms
rolled drops of scented dew like the tears of a weeping
enchantress.</p>

<p>The air was faint with enchantment; the Ugly
Prince felt a languor creeping over his body. His senses
seemed to be fading from him, and, fearing that he
might be overcome by the strange atmosphere of the
place, he dashed through the bushes towards an open
space not far off. There his eyes fell on a tall, solitary
plant growing in the very centre of the clearing, and
perceiving it to be none other than the object of his
search, he threw himself upon the ground beside it,
took the Golden Heart from his bosom and pressed it
to his lips, covering it with passionate kisses.</p>

<p>His journey was done, his troubles ended; he had
now only to wait till the plant had grown as high as
his knee to bathe his face in the juice of the berries
and all would be well. He would go back across
the desert, through the Great Gates and over the
world to his Princess’s kingdom, a changed man, with
his happiness lying before him. He pictured the joy
of the King, the delight of the faithful little boy who
awaited him, and the clinging arms of his adored
Princess, as he lay hour after hour beside the green stem
and watched it grow taller and saw the berries begin to
take shape and colour. At last, it had grown almost to
the height of his knee, and, as he sat waiting in the
breaking daylight for the moment when he should
pluck his treasure, the Prince heard footsteps behind
him, and, springing to his feet, beheld a tattered figure
which started on seeing him, and then, with a long cry,
fell prostrate upon the earth.</p>

<p>In a moment he was beside it and raising in his arms
a man still young, but so bowed and emaciated by
illness and trouble, that he seemed scarcely able to stand.</p>

<p>“Leave me! leave me!” he cried, as the Ugly
Prince held him in the grasp of his strong arms.
“What brings you here? Have you, too, come for
the plant—the magic plant?”</p>

<p>“I have,” said the Prince firmly.</p>

<p>The unhappy man dropped his hands. “Then I am
too late,” he cried, “and I must die—for what can I do
against <span class='it'>you</span>?” And he glanced from his own trembling
form to the straight, strong limbs of the Ugly Prince.</p>

<p>And he bowed his head and wept till the Prince’s
heart bled to hear him.</p>

<p>“I beseech you, stop your tears,” he said kindly,
“and tell me what has brought you here?”</p>

<p>As he spoke these words his breath almost stopped,
for he foresaw, dawning on the very horizon of his
mind, the vague outlines of a possible sacrifice, so great,
so overwhelming, that he hardly dared to put it into
thoughts, and yet—it was there.</p>

<p>“I have come,” said the stranger, “from a long, long
distance and crossed the desert on foot. See my feet,
how they are bruised. My journey has taken two
years (for I am a poor man and must travel as best I
may) and, at times, I have hardly hoped to live to
the end; for I am suffering from a slow, fatal disease.
I have tried every cure in vain, and have been told by
a learned magician to seek out this plant as a last hope
of life. I have a wife whose whole heart is bound up
in mine, and little children. Their hopes have been
centred in me through these sad years since I left them
to begin my journey. I shall never see them again,
and they will go on, day by day, hoping for my return.
But that will never be now. That is my history. And
you, why are you here? What is yours?”</p>

<p>For answer, the Prince drew off his mask. “That
is mine,” he said.</p>

<p>His companion recoiled from him, shuddering.</p>

<p>The two men remained gazing dumbly upon each
other; then the Ugly Prince broke the silence.</p>

<p>“We are in the most horrible position,” he said,
“that two miserable men have ever been placed in.
Look,” and he pointed to the now fully-developed
plant, “in a few minutes one of us will have his
hopes fulfilled, and one of us will be in despair. Let
us suppose for a moment that I am that unhappy man
and that you, in your good fortune, will grant me a
favour. Let me have a little space in which to think it
all over. Give me your word to hold your hand from
plucking the berries while I try to face this trial and
make up my mind to what is coming. Should <span class='it'>I</span> take
the golden chance that lies here for one of us, a few
moments of respite will do you no injury; and, should
<span class='it'>you</span> profit by it, your happiness will be none the less
sweet for having granted the prayer of a man into whose
life no joy can ever shine again. Will you do this?”</p>

<p>The man looked at him narrowly. “I am in your
power,” he said, “for you are the stronger.”</p>

<p>“Let that go for nothing,” answered the Prince,
waving his hand impatiently. “I shall leave you alone.
I want your word that you will do nothing till I come
back.”</p>

<p>“I promise it,” replied the stranger.</p>

<p>And the Ugly Prince went, leaving the black mask
lying at his feet.</p>

<p>He entered a grove of trees which stood near, and
flung his arms round the stem of a tall ash, pressing his
unmasked face against the bark; dreadful thoughts
assailed him on every side. He had only to go back
and drive his sword into that powerless body and the
happiness which had seemed so real a short time ago
would still be his. None could see the deed or tell of
it. His mind was as though filled with evil mists,
and, above them, rose the alluring form of his Princess,
golden-haired, white-armed, beckoning. But he thrust
her from him. No, such a thing could not be. Better
to die a thousand times than to sink into such dishonour
as that.</p>

<p>And if he relinquished his chance? If he were to
give up to that suffering mortal the thing that he had
striven and toiled for during the two years through
which he had dragged his poor aching limbs to this
spot, what then? Whose happiness would he destroy
by so doing? Not the Princess’s, certainly. She had
given him up of her free will, had shrunk from the
sight of him and the thought of becoming his wife.
The King, her father, would sorrow indeed, but he
would still have his daughter. The little boy would
welcome him back should he return as he had left him.
No, it would be his loss alone.</p>

<p>He thought of that evening in the Palace garden,
his last evening of happiness. He saw it all again,
the golden sky, the roses, the far-stretching landscape,
and he felt again the soft hand of his love clinging to
his arm as they talked together. He groaned, and,
as he thought of these things, some words came back
to his memory, words he had remembered on that
last happy evening, words which had once been
spoken by the Princess when she threw him the
Golden Heart. “<span class='it'>If you take it, it will bring you pain
and sorrow, perhaps more than you can bear. Can you
really accept it? Are you willing to take the trouble that
must come?</span>” He had not realised them then. Once
more they had returned to his mind when she
asked him to release her, and he had then imagined
that he understood them. He understood them
now.</p>

<p>And his rival? Perhaps he adored that wife as
he himself had adored, and did adore, his lost love.
And the wife, to whom his own success would mean
a life-long grief? He tried to put himself in the
unhappy man’s place. He tried to suppose that the
Princess was waiting for him, that she was sitting
watching as this woman watched. What should he
feel if another and a stronger hand were to grasp the
prize upon which all their hopes of meeting depended?
And the little children?</p>

<p>A great lump rose in his throat and a hand seemed
to clutch at his heartstrings; he looked up at the early
mist rolling away from stream and plain, and a load of
black temptation lifted heavily from his bursting heart.
The stranger stood waiting a little way off; he
approached him and laid a hand on his shoulder.</p>

<p>“Go!” he said, pointing to the plant. “It is
yours. Take it. I give up my claim freely.”</p>

<p>A few minutes more and he was lying on the earth
near the still pool he had seen the night before, his
cheek resting on the cool moss, trying to realise and
accept the loveless life which was all he had now left.
Every hope was gone and the future lay before him
like the vast, sterile desert he had lately crossed, bare
and bleak. There was nothing to live for now, nothing.
The fact rushed over him in its full meaning, and for
the first time since his boyhood he burst into tears and
sobbed like a little child.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p>After a while he remembered the mask which lay
on the grass where he had left it. There was nothing
for him to do but resume it and go back to the
world with his old trouble unchanged; but, before
rising, he went to bathe his heated eyes in the water
and he leaned over the brink. Just as he put in his
hand he saw that another face was looking up at him
It startled him. Was it some poor, drowned man
who lay staring up at the sky? Impossible, surely. None
knew of this place but himself and that one stranger,
and, moreover, there was no sign of death in those
living eyes that met his own so fearlessly. He plunged
down his hand and it only touched the bed of the pool;
the water lay deep and still but for the ripples which
his action had stirred into widening rings. He was
simply bewildered. Still gazing downwards he drew
his hand over his eyes, thinking they must be bewitched,
and, as he did so, a hand passed over the face in the
water. It could not be his own. He laughed bitterly
at the idea. It had no resemblance to himself, and was
the face of a handsome man, not a monster whose very
look was unendurable. Thinking that he must be
going mad, he felt the Golden Heart beating and
fluttering against his breast. He wondered that he had
forgotten it for so long as he took it out.</p>

<p>“Am I crazed?” he asked excitedly. “What is
this illusion?”</p>

<p>“It is no illusion,” replied the voice, “but the
truth. That face looking from the water is your
own. Look once more, for the ripples have ceased.”</p>

<p>The Prince obeyed.</p>

<p>He saw the most noble countenance that it had ever
entered his mind to imagine; no defect was there, no
feature which was not perfection, and over all was an
expression of such sublime grandeur, strength, and fortitude,
that the Ugly Prince, ugly no longer, drew
back, almost awed by what he saw.</p>

<p>“It is only the reflection of your own great soul,”
said the voice—and it seemed to fill the air around him—“what
you see is the beauty of honour and truth,
of courage and sacrifice, and there is nothing which
can be compared to it in the whole world. Now rise,
for you must go from here and begin your homeward
journey. Go back to reap the reward which is awaiting
you, for there is no reward too great for such as
you.”</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p>So the Prince went. The cormorant’s wings bore
him safely over the desert, and the witch’s shoe opened
for him the Great Gates. Once through them, he
procured himself a horse, and at last reached the borders
of the kingdom where his heart lay; here he proceeded
more slowly, only journeying by night, as he
wished no one to see him who might tell the Princess
of his return.</p>

<p>One morning early the little boy rose and went,
as he always did, to a high turret in the palace to
look down the road leading to the nearest city, and to
see whether his Prince was coming home.</p>

<p>As he sat with the morning breeze lifting his hair,
straining his eyes towards the white road which lay
between the ripening corn-fields, he saw a solitary
horseman approaching, and, in great excitement, he
watched him as he advanced. When he was still
some way off, the rider put his horse to a gallop,
waving his hand, and the child, doubting no longer,
rushed at the top of his speed down the turret stair,
through the courtyard gate, across the drawbridge,
and down the road till he reached the horse’s side and
clung, transported with joy, to the stirrup. The Prince
stooped and lifted him into the saddle before him.</p>

<p>When the first rapture of greeting was over, the
little boy raised his head from his friend’s shoulder.</p>

<p>“Where is your mask?” he inquired.</p>

<p>“It is here, but I do not wear it any more. You
see, I am not so ugly now,” said the Prince, smiling.</p>

<p>The little boy hugged him again with delight. “I
never saw your face before,” he said, “but I don’t
believe you were ever ugly. There is no one in the
world like you.”</p>

<p>Then the Prince asked him a thousand questions
about the Princess.</p>

<p>“She is not very happy,” replied the child, shaking
his head, “for, after you left, she began to miss you
and to cry because you had gone, and she has watched
for you so long, that she grows paler and sadder every
day.”</p>

<p>“Do you think she would love me if I came back
with my mask on, as I left her?” asked the Prince.</p>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<p><span class='pageno' title='42' id='Page_42'></span></p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/042.jpg' alt='princess in a garden with a prince and peacocks' id='iid-0004' style='width:80%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<p>“Try,” said the little boy.</p>

<p>They rode together through the gate and crossed the
courtyard hand in hand, the Prince in his travel-worn
clothes with the black mask on his face. Through
the wide hall they went, down the corridor, and out
into the Princess’s garden. She was standing in the
morning sunlight feeding her peacocks, the gorgeous
birds crowding round her; the eyes in their sweeping
tails flashed blue and green, and their slim necks
bent hither and thither as they picked up the grain.
They trod as softly as they could, like two conspirators,
so that she did not hear their footsteps until they were
close behind her. Then she turned, half-startled, and
saw the Prince.</p>

<p>For one moment she stood gazing at him with her
hands clasped over her heart; then, with a low cry of
joy, she sprang forward like some beautiful wild animal
and threw herself into his arms.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p>“And can you really receive me back like this?” he
asked a short time later, “when you see that it is the
same man who has returned unaltered?”</p>

<p>“Ah, do not remind me of my folly,” she begged,
“I can hardly believe that you have come back to me
at last; I fear to wake and find it is all a dream.”
And she rested her head against his shoulder with a
sigh of content.</p>

<p>“But,” persisted he, “could you bear to see me without
my mask?”</p>

<p>“I can bear anything,” she replied, “but losing you
again.”</p>

<p>Then he took off his mask and threw it on the
ground. She glanced up at him and stood transfixed,
for never in her whole life had she seen any one who
looked as he looked.</p>

<p>She sank on her knees beside him, and covered her
face with her hands. “I am not worthy to be your
wife,” she faltered, “let me go, for it cannot be.”</p>

<p>But he did not listen to her.</p>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<div><span class='pageno' title='45' id='Page_45'></span><h1>THE STORY OF THE SORCERER’S SONS AND THE TWO PRINCESSES OF JAPAN</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>O</span>nce</span> upon a time there were two Princesses
of Japan who lived with their father in a tall
palace. It stood on the banks of a river, and
they used to watch from the walls to see the
boats plying up and down, and the great cranes
standing in the shallows fishing.</p>

<p>They had never in their lives been outside the
gardens, except when they were carried in a litter
covered with paintings and carvings, and shut in
by curtains. They peeped through the chinks
as they went along, and Princess Azalea, the
elder, used to tell Princess Anemone long stories
which she invented about the passers-by. Once,
indeed, when the servants had put down the litter
for a moment’s rest, Princess Anemone, who was bolder
than her sister, though not quite so good at making up
stories, had slipped quietly out and gone off for a little
exploring expedition of her own; while Princess
Azalea sat terrified on the cushions, hiding her face
behind her little fan. It seemed an age to her till the
truant came back, breathless and rather pink in the
face.</p>

<p>“Oh! Sister! Sister! What did you see?” she
asked, “and how you have torn your dress! What
<span class='it'>will</span> Utuka say?”</p>

<p>Utuka was their nurse; she had brought them up
since Azalea was born, sixteen years before.</p>

<p>Anemone looked down at her white silk dress, all
covered with silver flowers, and at the three-cornered
slit which ran right across the front. “Never mind,”
she said, “I’ll sew it up before she sees it. I know
where she keeps her needles. Azalea, there was a man
with a long staff who scowled at me so. I ran back as
hard as I could, but O sister! look what I found!
The world is a charming place, I know.”</p>

<p>And she held up a great cream and pink peony.</p>

<p>So the two stood, day after day, looking out over
the palace wall, two white and gold figures with their
hair done up in little knobs on the tops of their heads,
and their fans fluttering like butterflies’ wings. The
sun poured down on them, and the blue sky stretched
above, and the great, unlimited world, which they knew
nothing about, lay all round them.</p>

<p>Now, the Princesses’ father was such a popular man
that there was only one person on that side of the
world so much talked about, and that was the Sorcerer
Badoko. The Emperor thought very seldom of the
Sorcerer, because he had little time for thinking of
anything but how to be kind to his neighbours; but
Badoko could hardly sleep in his bed at night for
thinking of the Emperor. He tossed about in his
lonely cave, saying under his breath that, come what
might, he would make himself the more celebrated of
the two. He said it under his breath, so that his two
sons, who were lying close by, should not hear him.
He did not like his two sons very much.</p>

<p>He could not at all make out why the Princesses’ father
was more admired than himself, for even Sorcerers are
stupid sometimes—generally because they think themselves
so clever. The real reason was because the old
man was so kind, but the Sorcerer did not know
that. He was clever enough to see that the
Emperor was more thought of than himself, but he
wasn’t clever enough to know why. At last he made
up his mind that it must be because he was richer,
and, having come to that conclusion, he determined to
steal away the two Princesses. Then he would go to
the palace and demand a great ransom—in fact, half the
Emperor’s money—and he felt sure that it would be paid.</p>

<p>The Emperor’s garden was full of beautiful trees.
In one corner a fountain played, and, near this, a flight
of steps ran up to a summer-house on the wall in
which the Princesses sat nearly every day and looked
down on the world below.</p>

<p>As they were sitting there one afternoon they saw
an old man passing by. It was the same person who
had scowled at Anemone when she ran away from the
litter, and she pointed him out to her sister. He
glanced up at the two girls. Under his arm he carried
a kind of guitar; Azalea looked at it with interest, for,
besides making up stories, she could sing and play very
prettily to a little instrument she had, which was rather
like this one.</p>

<p>The Sorcerer—for it was he—made an extremely
low bow.</p>

<p>“Shall I sing you a song, my ladies?” he asked.</p>

<p>Anemone felt bolder than ever, for was not the wall
between them? “Yes, please,” she said.</p>

<p>Then the Sorcerer began to sing; and his voice was
like liquid gold. It made one think of all the most
beautiful things in the world: of the dawn in the sky,
of great birds with white wings, of rushing waters, of
prancing horses and waving plumes, of the deep velvet
sky with its armies of stars.</p>

<p>“Oh, how lovely! How wonderful!” cried the
Princesses. “Oh, sir! where did you learn those
songs?”</p>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<p><span class='pageno' title='48' id='Page_48'></span></p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/048.jpg' alt='man under a tree playing an instrument' id='iid-0005' style='width:80%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<p>The Sorcerer smiled. “It is this little guitar,” he
said, holding it up. “It is bewitched. One has only
to strike the strings and the song comes out of it.
Your ladyships think, no doubt, that it is I who sing,
but I have only to open my mouth and the guitar does
all the rest.”</p>

<p>Now this was a lie, for the Sorcerer’s two sons
made all the songs; they were very clever young
men.</p>

<p>“Sing one more; please sing one more!” cried the
Princesses.</p>

<p>“Very well,” replied he, “one more, but that
must be the last. Here is one which I hope you
will like. It is called ‘The Peach Trees in the
Valley.’ ”</p>

<p>“What a charming name,” said Anemone, who was
fond of flowers.</p>

<p>And the Sorcerer sang:—</p>

<p>The girls were charmed, and, as for Azalea, she was
so much excited she was almost in tears.</p>

<p>“If your ladyships like my guitar so much why do
you not buy it?” said Badoko. “I am very poor, and
I am taking it into the city to sell.”</p>

<p>Azalea wrung her hands; she had never been in such
a predicament before. “But we have no money,” she
exclaimed.</p>

<p>It had never entered the Princesses’ minds to think
of money. Everything they wanted was always there
ready for them, and it had never in their lives occurred
to them to ask how it came.</p>

<p>The Sorcerer laughed rather slyly. “But surely his
Imperial Majesty will not grudge you the money,” said he.</p>

<p>“Run, Anemone, run, and ask our father!” cried
Azalea.</p>

<p>“It would be better for you to look at the guitar
before buying it,” remarked the Sorcerer.</p>

<p>Anemone was practical, and this idea struck her as
being very wise. “Wait,” she said to her sister, “we
will go down to the gate and see it.”</p>

<p>And the two ran down the stairs with a great rustling
of silks and clacking of little heels.</p>

<p>When they got out of the door the Sorcerer made
another low bow, and held out the musical instrument.
Azalea took it eagerly in her hand, and at the same time
Badoko made a whistling sound. Two men sprang
from behind a bush and threw heavy cloaks over the
sisters, winding them so tightly over their mouths that
they could not scream, though they tried to with all
their might. The wicked Sorcerer laughed aloud,
and ordered his men to carry the Princesses down to
the river.</p>

<p>The garden opened on a lonely piece of waste ground,
so they met no one on the way, reaching the shore and
embarking under the shade of a thick tree in a long
flat boat. Soon they had pushed off and were floating
down the stream, Azalea and Anemone lying covered
up under some grass matting, and Badoko steering
while his men rowed. Behind them, the city was
losing itself in the distance.</p>

<p>When the Princesses were allowed to come out of
their hiding-place they found themselves in a wide
country; the river wound on through stretches of sand;
barren mountains, like great blue stone-heaps, covered
the desert. They wept very piteously as they sat
huddled together. Before them, Badoko’s grim image
sat stiffly against the sky, and behind them, the bare
country into which they were going spread for miles
and miles; all round was sand and the dry reeds rustled
as they passed. They held each other’s hands, and
sobbed softly for fear he should hear. They would
have liked to ask him if he was going to kill them,
but they were much too frightened. Besides this,
they were very uncomfortable, and they had left their
little fans behind. It was all very dreadful. Just
before sunset they stopped by the bare stump of a tree
which was sticking up among the rushes; on it sat a
black raven looking very wise and cawing loudly. He
looked at the matting which covered the girls, and
pointed at the Sorcerer with his claw.</p>

<p>“What have you got there?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Mind your own business,” said Badoko, throwing
a great stone at him.</p>

<p>He flew away, flapping his wings angrily, but he
turned his head round as he went and saw Azalea and
Anemone getting out upon the bank. The Sorcerer
was offering them some horrible black bread and some
dried peas, for he did not want them to die of hunger.
If they did, he would lose all the money he hoped to
get from their father.</p>

<p>But they were not hungry, and only shuddered as
they sat close together on the sand.</p>

<p>“If you don’t want any food,” said Badoko, “don’t
sit there whining and wasting my time.” And he
dragged them into the boat again.</p>

<p>The raven spread his wings and flew far away up
the river, and when he had gone nearly a hundred miles,
he saw the Emperor’s palace underneath him. He lit
upon the roof and began to caw and squall at the top
of his voice, and to dance in such a way that everybody
below crowded to look at him. The Emperor,
who was inside, put out his head to see what all the
laughter meant. The tears had been running down his
face as he thought of his two little girls who had disappeared
so strangely, and his nose was quite red, poor
old gentleman, but he rubbed his face on his silk
handkerchief and went down to the courtyard, followed
by his Prime Minister. All the servants were collected
and were staring up at the raven.</p>

<p>“What is all this about?” inquired the Prime
Minister, as he strutted after his master.</p>

<p>“Sir, it is a raven which is dancing on the roof in
a very diverting manner,” said a bystander.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister was accustomed to be the principal
person in any crowd, and he was not best pleased
at finding himself scarcely regarded; nobody was
regarding the Emperor either, but he did not think of
that. He put on his spectacles and looked up.</p>

<p>“How very unsuitable!” he exclaimed, turning his
back. “Really, what we are all coming to <span class='it'>I</span> don’t
know!”</p>

<p>The bird danced still more extravagantly, and even
the Emperor began to smile.</p>

<p>“Come down from there immediately!” shouted
the Prime Minister; “I wonder you are not ashamed
of making such an exhibition of yourself.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said the bird; and he flew down, alighting
at his Majesty’s feet, making so polished an
obeisance that all were astonished.</p>

<p>The Emperor was much gratified. “What can I
do for you?” he inquired.</p>

<p>“I have important news,” replied the bird, “and I
would ask to communicate it.”</p>

<p>“Impudent scoundrel!” exclaimed the Prime
Minister, “your right place would be in the cooking-pot
if you were not so nasty.”</p>

<p>“It would certainly be fitter for me than for you,”
observed the raven, “seeing that you are old and
tough and that I am young and tender.”</p>

<p>“Your Majesty must not think of giving the audience
unattended,” said the Prime Minister; “this disreputable
creature may have some design upon your
royal life. Someone should be present.”</p>

<p>“Anyone, so long as it is not yourself,” replied the
raven.</p>

<p>And with that, he hopped into the palace in front
of the Emperor, who was too much agitated to notice
the breach of etiquette. The Prime Minister hurried
after, hoping to get in also, but he was too late, for the
guard who stood at the door shut it behind his Majesty
according to custom. The Emperor seated himself and
the bird stood respectfully before him.</p>

<p>“Is it anything about my poor little daughters that
you have come to tell me?” he asked, looking very
pitifully into the raven’s face.</p>

<p>“Your Majesty is right,” was the reply. “I myself
saw them, not twenty-four hours ago, but in
great distress. The Sorcerer Badoko has stolen them
away.”</p>

<p>“Where has he taken them to? Where? Where?”
cried the Emperor.</p>

<p>“They were rowing down the river in the direction
of Badoko’s country. I have put myself to great inconvenience
to bring this news to your Majesty; and
it is lucky that that pig of a Prime Minister did not
dissuade you from listening to me. Why such a mud-headed
gander should be allowed near your sacred
person, <span class='it'>I</span> don’t know.”</p>

<p>“He means well, he means well,” said the Emperor.</p>

<p>“He means to put me in a pot if he can get me,”
replied the raven. “I only hope and trust he may
not catch me until I have restored the young ladies to
their illustrious parent.”</p>

<p>At this moment there was a loud knocking at the
door.</p>

<p>“Who is there?” cried the Emperor.</p>

<p>“May it please your Imperial Majesty,” said the
guard outside, “the Prime Minister says it is cold in
the palace and that you have forgotten your Imperial
Majesty’s muffler, and he will bring it in himself.”</p>

<p>“What does he say?” asked the monarch, who was
rather deaf.</p>

<p>The raven repeated the message.</p>

<p>“Thanks, thanks; tell him I am very comfortable,”
said the Emperor.</p>

<p>The raven hopped to the door.</p>

<p>“Tell him,” he bawled, “that his Majesty says he is
to mind his own business and keep his bald head away
from the key-hole.”</p>

<p>When the Emperor heard what the bird had got to
say he determined to set out with a great force for
Badoko’s country.</p>

<p>When the expedition was ready, they started, travelling
in great force. The procession was several miles
long, and, in the centre of it, immediately behind his
Majesty, the raven was carried on a silver perch
which was made in the form of a bower. Over his
head swung a scarlet canopy, like an umbrella, which
protected him from the rays of the sun, and under
which he languished with all the airs of royalty.
This he did because the Prime Minister’s litter was
close behind, and because he knew that its occupant
could see him. The slaves who carried him hated
him, for his voice was never silent and he poured
abuse upon them from dawn till dusk.</p>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<p><span class='pageno' title='56' id='Page_56'></span></p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/056.jpg' alt='long parade of people' id='iid-0006' style='width:80%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<p>And now we must ask what had been happening all
this time to the two Princesses. When the raven had
flown away from the spot where he had seen them,
they were hurried into the boat again, and continued
their way till they reached the place where Badoko
lived. It was a sandy desert with great rocks in
which there were caves. To these caves, which were
high up, staircases were cut in the stone, and the
Sorcerer’s servant sat in the entrance of one, boiling a
cauldron from which the steam went up in a column.
They disembarked, and Badoko marched them up one
of the flights of steps. “Here,” said he, “is the cave
you are to live in. If you want anything to eat you
can ask for something out of the cauldron.”</p>

<p>Azalea and Anemone were very hungry, so they
begged a little food and went into their cave, glad
to be away from his terrible eye. After some time
they heard Badoko giving orders down below.</p>

<p>“Now,” he cried to his servant, “I am going on
a journey. You are to take care that the Princesses
do not escape, for if I come back and find them
gone, I will put everybody to death for miles
round!”</p>

<p>The servant fell at his feet and promised he would
do all he was told, and Badoko, calling together the
men who had rowed his boat, mounted a white donkey
with pink eyes and rode away at their head across the
sand.</p>

<p>When night came, Azalea and Anemone lay down,
but they could not rest; and, as it was bright moonlight,
they sat at the top of their staircase, looking out
over the shining ground.</p>

<p>It was not long before they saw two figures ride up
and dismount below. They did not know what new
enemies these might be, so they crept softly back into
the cave and tried to sleep.</p>

<p>The Sorcerer’s two sons—for the riders were none
other—were named Tiger and Gold-Eagle, for
Badoko had thought these names lucky. They had
come a long distance and were very tired, and as, when
at home, they inhabited a cave next to the one in
which the Princesses lay, they went in and threw
themselves down on the piles of skins which served
them for beds. In the middle of the night Tiger
woke his companion.</p>

<p>“Brother,” he said, “what is that strange noise?”</p>

<p>Gold-Eagle sat up; he was very cross at being
awakened from his first sleep. “If you annoy me
again,” he said, throwing a handful of sand at Tiger,
“I will get out of bed and beat you.”</p>

<p>As he spoke the noise grew more distinct.</p>

<p>“There’s someone crying close by,” said Tiger; “I
shall go in and see what it means.”</p>

<p>Gold-Eagle was quite as inquisitive as his brother, so
he rose, in spite of his bad humour, and followed.
What was their astonishment at seeing two girls lying
weeping on the floor. Azalea and Anemone fell at
their feet. The Sorcerer’s sons knew very well that
these must be some prisoners of their father’s, and as
they disapproved of his wickedness, they were horrified
at seeing the distress in which the poor little things
were plunged. They soon heard their history, for,
when the Princesses saw how kindly they looked at
them, they were only too glad to have someone to talk
to, and they implored Tiger and Gold-Eagle to protect
them.</p>

<p>The two brothers were so much charmed that they
immediately fell head-over-ears in love, and it was
fortunate that Tiger preferred Azalea and Gold-Eagle
Anemone, or there might have been a fight. They
promised to help them to escape from Badoko and to
take them back to their father, for, though they would
be dreadfully sorry to part with them, they could not
bear to think of them in the power of the wicked
Sorcerer. Next day they went to the servant who
was left in charge of the captives and asked where
Badoko had gone.</p>

<p>“Young sirs,” said he, “his Honour has gone to
consult the illustrious Dragon about the ransom which
he will ask for the Princesses.”</p>

<p>Now the Sorcerer had a friend, a very rich Dragon
who lived on an island some way off, and it was to
visit him that he had set out on the pink-eyed donkey.
The brothers knew that he could not get back for
several days, and they told Azalea and Anemone that
they would start as soon as their horses should be
rested.</p>

<p>It was night when they left; the sky was clear and
the steam from the servants’ cauldron rose in the moonlight.
When he saw what the brothers were doing
he remonstrated loudly, but nobody listened, so he
could only promise to tell Badoko which way they had
gone the moment he returned.</p>

<p>“You won’t get the chance,” said Gold-Eagle, giving
him a cuff, “for you are coming too.” And he drove
him along in front of them.</p>

<p>For three days all went well; as the brothers walked
while the Princesses rode, the horses had not much to
carry.</p>

<p>They were resting in a wood one day, when they
were suddenly surrounded by a band of robbers, who
sprang on them, and, before they could resist, tied
them to trees while they sat down to decide what was
to be done with them. Gold-Eagle and Tiger were
furious and gnashed their teeth, but there was nothing
they could do, poor fellows, for the robbers numbered
about forty to their two. The head robber came into
the circle holding the beautiful embroidered dresses he
had taken from Anemone and Azalea. “These are
worth a great deal,” said he; “if we take them to the
Dragon who lives on the island we shall get a large
sum; he is a great collector of curiosities, and we
can sell the young men to him for slaves, and the
girls too, for that matter. This has been a great
find.”</p>

<p>You may imagine what the Princesses felt when
they heard that!</p>

<p>We must now see what the Emperor and his train
were doing, and how near they had got to the Sorcerer’s
country. Every night they halted by the wayside, and
the raven had a tent all to himself next to that of his
Majesty. It was made of velvet and the royal arms
were emblazoned on it; but, had you heard the raven
talking about it, you would have supposed it to be no
better than a dog-kennel. Nothing was good enough
for him. The sentry who walked up and down before
it was maddened by the offensive looks which the bird
cast upon him as he passed and repassed the door.</p>

<p>One evening a shabby-looking rook flew by the
camp, and, seeing so fine a tent occupied by one of his
own kind, he went up to it, and, putting on a sad
voice, began to beg. The raven, who was in front of
a glass admiring a gold collar which the Emperor had
caused to be put round his neck, stuck his beak in the
air. “Sentry!” he called, “rid me at once of this
pestilent bird. His presence is an offence to me.”</p>

<p>But the rook’s voice drowned the words. “Sir!”
he cried, “great sir! Let me tell your noble Honour’s
fortune. I see by the glorious jewels on your neck
that you must be a king.”</p>

<p>“No, no, my good fellow,” answered the raven,
“you mistake, indeed. Your admiration for my person
and manners leads you into error.”</p>

<p>“Then it is easy to see by your appearance that you
are some great lord,” continued the rook.</p>

<p>“There, I confess, you have me,” said the raven,
looking down.</p>

<p>“Let me tell your Honourable Lordship’s noble
fortune?” cried the rook again. “A great destiny is
in store for you—though, to be sure, anyone who sees
you can read that in your high-born and illustrious
eye.”</p>

<p>“Sentry!” cried the raven, “I have made a mistake.
I shall not require your intervention.”</p>

<p>The rook then approached humbly and began telling
his fortune, assuring him that every dignity and honour
would be his, that he would die lamented after having
ruled the greater part of the earth, and that he would
owe all these things to the virtue of his own heart and
the lofty perfection of his intellect.</p>

<p>“My good creature,” said the raven, “you interest
me. Not only do you seem to be in the front rank of
the prophets, but you appear to possess discernment of
character to a very unusual degree. How have you
learnt so many accurate and valuable things?”</p>

<p>“Powerful Nobleman,” replied the rook, “though
my appearance is mean, I have yet frequented august
society—though I have never, of course, been in the
presence of such combined rectitude and splendour as
that in which I now find myself. Indeed, I have just
come from a place where riches are stored such as have
seldom been collected in this world.”</p>

<p>“Where is that?” inquired the raven.</p>

<p>“I have come from the island of a powerful Dragon
who has immense wealth and a great collection of
curiosities. He has an exalted guest with him at this
moment, a man of great note, who——”</p>

<p>“Vermin, you begin to weary me,” said the raven;
“who is this person?”</p>

<p>“The Sorcerer Badoko,” replied the rook.</p>

<p>The raven started. “And who else?” he cried.</p>

<p>“There are also two young gentlemen, sons of the
illustrious Sorcerer, and two beautiful young ladies
named Azalea and Anemone, whom gossips say are
Princesses. But they did not arrive with Badoko.
They were brought to the Dragon by robbers and are
now in dungeons. The Sorcerer disapproves of his
sons, I hear, and would not be sorry to see them put
to death.”</p>

<p>The raven was all eagerness to give this news to
the Emperor. “Be off, bird!” he said, “I have had
enough of your talk.”</p>

<p>“But the fee, Gracious Monarch! My fee for
telling your fortune!”</p>

<p>The raven fell into a towering rage and began to
call for the sentry. The rook snatched up a valuable
gold chain from a table and made off as hard as he
could go, leaving the raven unable to pursue him on
account of the heavy ornaments he wore.</p>

<p>Outside the Emperor’s tent the raven set up a great
cry of “News! News!”</p>

<p>The Emperor commanded him to enter, and he
related what had happened. “But I divined it all in
a dream first,” he added, “so, when the low creature
appeared, I knew exactly what he was going to say.”</p>

<p>The expedition started with all haste for the Dragon’s
island and sighted it in a few days; it was evening
when they approached the lake in which it lay, and
they saw the single pine tree which stood on it and
one star shining above in the green of the evening sky.
But they had no leisure to admire all this and pushed
on to find that the Dragon had gone to a palace some
way from the shore where he was entertaining the
Sorcerer with a feast. The only persons left on the
island were the Sorcerer’s sons and the Princesses who
were confined in dungeons below the Dragon’s treasure
house. The force surrounded the palace in which the
feast was going on and turned their heavy guns on it.
The Dragon and the Sorcerer came out in great
horror, and the Dragon was told that he would be
blown to atoms if the captives were not released immediately
and Badoko given up to justice.</p>

<p>“Take all I have,” said the Dragon, “but spare my
collection of curiosities.”</p>

<p>So the Princesses were set free and, with them, Tiger
and Gold-Eagle, and the Sorcerer was seized, bound,
and drowned in the lake. The raven stood by the
Emperor and surveyed all that was done. “My good
fellows,” he said to Badoko’s sons, “there is no further
need of your services. Your behaviour has been
creditable. You may go.”</p>

<p>“Do you want your neck wrung?” asked Gold-Eagle,
who had come behind him, taking him deftly
between his finger and thumb. The raven took the
first opportunity of retiring among the crowd.</p>

<p>Next day the Emperor with his daughters started for
home, having invited the young men to his court, and
they, after bidding the Princesses good-bye, returned to
Badoko’s country to fit themselves out suitably for the
visit.</p>

<p>So everybody departed in peace, except the Sorcerer,
who was at the bottom of the lake.</p>

<p>In a short time Tiger and Gold-Eagle arrived at the
court. They had inherited all their father’s wealth and
they came in such splendour and state that people ran
out of their houses for miles round to see them pass.</p>

<p>The Emperor was much delighted with their
appearance, character and accomplishments, and, above
all, with the charming way in which they played and
sang, so when Tiger asked him for the hand of Azalea
and Gold-Eagle for that of Anemone, he consented
readily, and the two marriages took place amid great
pomp. Everyone was pleased but the raven, who
could not get on with the Emperor’s sons-in-law.
Finally, he found it wiser to retire from court, and a
fine house was built for him in which he spent the
remainder of his days and died, at a good old age, of a
surfeit.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='67' id='Page_67'></span><h1>GRIMAÇON</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>O</span>nce</span> upon a time there lived in a very large and
important kingdom a Princess called Moonflower;
she was thus named on account of her
golden hair, which was two yards and a half
in length and shone like the moon. The
weight of this marvellous adornment was so
very great that she was obliged to have a dwarf,
who followed her wherever she went, and who
carried it as though it had been the train of
her gown. The dwarf, who was French,
was called Grimaçon; he was so clever that
there was hardly an accomplishment suitable
to his position in which he was not perfect.
He could dance in a manner which caused those who
beheld him to insist upon the performance being
repeated again and again; he could cook the most
delicate ragoûts and pasties; he could make such
unrivalled grimaces that all who saw them were transfixed—in
short, he was everything that a dwarf should
be. He had lived in all the most celebrated capitals
in Europe, and was acquainted with the manners and
customs of every country, and, while at Berlin, had
learnt to play the German bagpipe in the most accomplished
manner.</p>

<p>The parents of Princess Moonflower were both
dead, and the kingdom was being governed by the
sister of the deceased king until the Princess should
come of age and take the management of affairs, which
she was to do at the age of seventeen. But, if before
her seventeenth birthday she were to die, the kingdom
was to go to her aunt. Now the Princess’s aunt was
very ambitious and proud, and could not look upon the
idea of giving it up to her niece without dismay.
“What!” she exclaimed, “is this little wretch to
supplant me? Am I, with all my wisdom, to be set
aside with ignominy for a little fool who has no
recommendation but her paltry beauty?” And she
began to think of every means in her power by which
she could get rid of the Princess.</p>

<p>So she determined that she must never be allowed to
see her seventeenth birthday, and at last made up her
mind to kill her, though she disliked the job, and put
off doing it from day to day.</p>

<p>Now, there lived in that country a very wicked
Prince called Blackwig, with whom the cruel old
woman consulted. “Tell me, my good Blackwig,”
said she, “how I am to get rid of this tiresome Moonflower?
Bethink thyself, and I will give thee a box of
pearls, a pair of puce-coloured silk hose, and a dancing
ape. And, moreover, if thy counsel please me, thou
shalt also have an excellent recipe for a pâté of spiced
dolphin’s liver, which was given me by my sister, who
learned cooking in Paris.”</p>

<p>“Madam,” replied Blackwig, who was fond of good
living, “I desire nothing but to please you; but, as you
are so liberal in your offers, I will be the same with my
advice. Listen to me. Give me the hand of your
niece in marriage, and you shall not be troubled with
her long, for I know of a poison which I will put into
her soup and which will cause her to expire without
anyone’s knowing the reason—and all I will ask for
this is two thousand ducats!”</p>

<p>“That is a large sum,” said the Princess’s aunt, who
was very economical.</p>

<p>“Well, well, since you make me presents at the same
time, I will take one thousand five hundred and twenty-five
ducats, <span class='it'>but nothing less</span>.”</p>

<p>The Princess’s aunt, who was glad to be able to
charge someone else with the death of her niece, consented,
and went straight to Moonflower’s room, to
make known to her that she must prepare for her
coming marriage. She found her sitting at the
window, watering her flowers. She looked more
lovely than the three Graces. She wore a dress of
mauve velvet embroidered with bunches of amaryllis
in pearls and diamonds, and her long hair fell in
showers upon the ground.</p>

<p>“Little darling,” began the old woman, “I have
to-day had a proposal for your hand in marriage.”</p>

<p>“And from whom, Madam?” inquired Moonflower.</p>

<p>“The Prince Blackwig,” said her aunt: “he loves
you to distraction, and will make an excellent
husband.”</p>

<p>“Fie!” exclaimed the Princess, “he squints and has
bandy legs, besides being the most malicious person in
the world.”</p>

<p>“Nevertheless, I command you to obey me and to
marry him!” shrieked the Princess’s aunt.</p>

<p>“I will not,” said Moonflower, “I would rather
die.”</p>

<p>“And die thou shalt, little viper!” bawled the old
woman, “for I will cut you in little pieces if you do
not marry him this day month!” And she left the
room in a rage, banging the door behind her.</p>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<p><span class='pageno' title='70' id='Page_70'></span></p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/070.jpg' alt='queen wearing a crown and a seated princess' id='iid-0007' style='width:80%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<p>When she had gone, the Princess began to weep
bitterly and wring her hands. “Alas! my good
Grimaçon,” she said to the dwarf, “what shall I do?
Was there ever a being so unfortunate as I? Either
I must perish or wed the odious Blackwig, and I
know not which of these two horrors to choose.”</p>

<p>“You must fly, your Royal Highness,” answered
the dwarf, who was a sensible little fellow, “before
the day which the Queen Regent has named.”</p>

<p>“But alas!” said Moonflower, “whither shall I
go?”</p>

<p>“It wants but two months to your seventeenth
birthday,” replied he, “when you will succeed to the
kingdom. If you conceal yourself till then, you can
afterwards return and claim it, and your aunt will
have no power over your actions when once you are
on the throne.”</p>

<p>The next day Princess Moonflower and the faithful
Grimaçon fled from the palace. They walked
along the most secret and quiet roads for fear of
observation, till at last they came to a huge forest,
through which they travelled for some distance, and,
aching with fatigue, sank down under a tree to rest.
The little dwarf, who had been carrying his mistress’s
long hair, threw himself at her feet on the grass, for
he was very weary.</p>

<p>“Alas, dear Grimaçon,” she said, “how cruel is our
lot! We shall certainly be devoured by wild beasts in
this terrible wood.” And she began crying and
weeping. Her sighs and lamentations might have
touched a heart of stone. All at once she looked
up, for there stood before her a little crooked woman,
more hideous than a witch.</p>

<p>“Daughter,” she croaked in a voice like a raven’s,
“will you direct me in the way to the palace?”</p>

<p>The Princess pointed in the direction from which
she had just come.</p>

<p>“Go a little distance with me,” implored the hag,
“and help me to carry this bundle I have got on my
back.”</p>

<p>Poor Moonflower was very tired, but she took up the
bundle and, telling Grimaçon to await her in the same
spot, she walked off with her strange companion.
When they had gone for about half a mile the old
woman stopped her.</p>

<p>“A thousand thanks,” she croaked, “and now, I will
give you the reward of your civility.”</p>

<p>So saying, she plucked a leaf from a neighbouring
bush and presented it to the astonished girl.</p>

<p>“When you are in distress think of me and touch
this leaf with the third finger of your left hand.” And,
almost before the words were out of her mouth, she had
disappeared.</p>

<p>Full of surprise, the Princess went back to where the
faithful dwarf awaited her and told him her adventure.
“And now,” she said, “I will touch my leaf and we
shall be out of this terrible wood, where I feel sure
there are nothing but monsters and savage beasts who
will tear us limb from limb. It will certainly save us
from our difficulties.”</p>

<p>“No, your Royal Highness,” he replied, “at least
let us wait till the wild beasts come—we may be in
very much worse straits yet. Let us reserve our
resources till then.”</p>

<p>They journeyed on through the forest, and, at last,
arrived at a little stream which ran merrily along till it
came to a fallen branch lying right across it, and
against which so many leaves and twigs had drifted
that the course of the water was stopped. The stream
was forced out of its bed, and beat itself against the bank.</p>

<p>“Look at that pretty stream,” remarked Moonflower,
“how sadly it dribbles along beyond the fallen branch.
The water cannot pass it. See, Grimaçon, with what
difficulty it flows.”</p>

<p>And she bent down and broke the branch in two, for
it was but a slight thing. All the accumulated leaves
and twigs sailed away and the stream flowed on in a
thousand beautiful ripples; at the same time a voice
sang the following words:—</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“Princess, should you need a friend,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;The grateful stream its aid will lend;</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;Should you need me, call, I pray,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;Hear the words that you must say,—</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;‘River rise and river fall,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;Send the help for which I call.’</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;—But, call me not till hope is lost,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;Or dear the words to you may cost.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p>“Well,” observed Grimaçon, who had heard these
lines, “friends are not to be despised when one has
fallen upon bad times, whatever shape they may assume—or
even if they assume no shape at all!”</p>

<p>They continued walking on into the wood, when
they heard behind them the sound of horns and of
horses galloping, and in the twinkling of an eye they
beheld the wicked Prince Blackwig, who was hunting
in the forest with his men. When he caught sight of
Moonflower he knew her at once by her long hair.
“Ho!” he cried, “here is our runaway!” for he had
already heard of her flight. He dismounted, and,
seizing her, placed her upon the saddle, then, leaping
up behind her, he put spurs to his horse. One of his
servants, seeing Grimaçon, picked him up, saying, “He
is a merry little ape, who will make us some sport.
Let us take him too.”</p>

<p>“Where are we going to?” asked the Princess of
Blackwig, as they flew along.</p>

<p>“To my castle,” answered the wicked Prince,
“where I will throw you and your hideous dwarf into
a dungeon in which you shall languish, if you will not
marry me as your aunt commands.”</p>

<p>“I will never marry thee,” replied she, “shouldst
thou tear me in bits for refusing.”</p>

<p>When they arrived at Blackwig’s castle the poor
captives were thrown into a frightful dungeon, which
had only one window, and that on a level with the
ground. The place was so deep, and the floor so far
down in the earth, that they could hardly see the light,
which appeared to them as a little, far-away star.
Blackwig was beside himself with fury with the
Princess, for, had she married him, he would have
gained all the rewards offered by her wicked aunt;
and, as he did not intend to poison her, but only to say
that he had done so, he hoped when his wife succeeded
to the kingdom to share the throne with her. Until
then, he intended to keep her hidden in his castle.
Truly, it would be a fine thing to be a king, and to
have outwitted so clever a woman.</p>

<p>The Princess and Grimaçon sat on the floor of their
horrible prison; it was so dark that, for a time, they
could hardly see; which was just as well, as the place
was full of toads and terrible creatures, and the bones of
those who had perished there before were strewn
around. At last, their eyes began to get accustomed to
the darkness, and Moonflower began to realise the
horrors of their position. “It is bad enough to perish
one’s self in such a place,” she said, “without having
brought thee also into trouble, my dear Grimaçon.”</p>

<p>“Take courage, Madame,” replied the dwarf, “I feel
sure that we shall surmount all obstacles, for now I
perceive that the time has come for you to use the
gifts you have been given. If you will take my
advice you will see what the stream, which promised
its help, can do for you.”</p>

<p>Half frightened by what she was doing, the Princess
repeated these words:—</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“River rise and river fall,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;Send the help for which I call!”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p>For some moments nothing happened; but presently
a little trickling was heard in the wall. It became
louder and louder, and at last, by the dim light, they
could distinguish a rivulet running in a tiny thread
out of a crack between the stones. It went on increasing
in volume until the water covered the floor and
rose round the Princess’s ankles. “Alas!” she cried,
“the cruel stream has played me false, and we shall
certainly be drowned like rats in this fearful place!”</p>

<p>“Wait a bit,” replied the dwarf, who was already
up to his knees; “do not despair, we still have the
leaf.”</p>

<p>Still the water continued to rise; the Princess, who
was horribly frightened, took the leaf that had been
given her from the bosom of her gown, and, thinking
of the old woman, touched it with the third finger of
her left hand. As she did so it began to spread and
spread, and at last grew so large and heavy that she
could no longer hold it but laid it down. It floated
like a boat on the water, and, though it still looked like
a leaf, it became the size of a good large tea-tray, and
then stopped growing.</p>

<p>Moonflower, who was up to her waist in water,
clung to the wonderful leaf, and at last succeeded in
seating herself upon it; she then helped Grimaçon to
do the same, for the little fellow had been swimming
for the last ten minutes. What was their surprise when
they got into this strange boat to find that the water
had not wet them, and that their clothes were perfectly
dry.</p>

<p>The flood rose and rose, and the leaf and its burden
rose with it, till at last they were half way up the wall,
and, in a surprisingly short time, had reached the level
of the window.</p>

<p>The water began rushing out of it, carrying the leaf
so swiftly that the Princess thought they would be
dashed against the window-bars. What was her wonder
on finding that, as the foremost point touched them,
they melted away, and with a cry of joy she and her
faithful dwarf sailed into the open air.</p>

<p>“Hold tightly, your Highness,” he exclaimed, “for
the pace we are going at is terrific.”</p>

<p>The water rushed headlong over fields and pastures,
carrying them for several miles, at the end of which it
joined itself to the stream the Princess had met in the
wood. Moonflower sailed smoothly along, past forests
and meadows, past castles and huts, till she came to the
city where her own palace stood. On the terrace of
the garden she beheld her wicked aunt walking up and
down (for the stream ran close by the palace walls).
She saw her gesticulating as she went, and heard her
cry out, “Miserable girl! Thank heaven she may
never return—the throne may yet be mine!”</p>

<p>On sailed the leaf, on and on, for seven days and
seven nights, till they came to a land which lay far
away from the Princess’s kingdom. The people who
saw her passing by in so singular a manner held up
their hands in wonder at the strange sight. Never had
they beheld whirled by them a beautiful girl, sitting
on a green leaf, with such a quantity of golden hair.
It flew out as she went like a golden fringe, and
when the sun struck upon it she looked as though she
were appearing in a cloud of gold. On account of
the brightness they could not see Grimaçon, who sat
behind her. Soon they came to a place where the
water ran between high trees, and where great blue
lotos-flowers were growing as high as a tall man, covering
the brink to the water’s edge.</p>

<p>While the Princess was admiring such rare and
beautiful flowers, the leaf ran against a protruding stone
and was carried by an eddy into the bank. Moonflower
jumped out and the dwarf followed her
example.</p>

<p>“Let us trust we may find something fit to eat,
if only roots and berries,” said he, “for we have
had neither meat nor drink for many days and
nights.”</p>

<p>Once on shore they were much astonished to
find that, on reaching land, their boat shrank to its
original size, and that Moonflower was able to take it
up in her hand. She thrust it again into the bosom of
her dress.</p>

<p>The dwarf Grimaçon began at once to look with
great diligence for something to eat, and soon discovered
some delicious fruit which grew in great
masses upon the surrounding trees. When they had
both enjoyed a hearty meal the Princess was overcome
by fatigue, for her long journey had exhausted
her.</p>

<p>“Lay yourself on yonder grass, Madame,” said
Grimaçon; “and, while you rest, I will watch over
your slumbers.” So she flung herself down under a
tree where the moss was like a cushion of green satin,
and was soon fast asleep.</p>

<p>Now it happened that there passed that way an aged
wood-cutter, who, with a load of faggots, was on his
way to the Palace belonging to the King of that
country, and who, as he went by, was much surprised
to behold, under a tree, the most beautiful
maiden in the world, with hair shining like gold and
lying spread on the grass like the rays of the moon.
He was yet more taken aback by the sight of
Grimaçon, who sat beside her, shading her from the
sun with a branch which he also used to drive away
the flies.</p>

<p>“What is the name of this country, grandfather?”
cried the dwarf.</p>

<p>“This is the kingdom of the King of the Crystal
Mountains,” replied the greybeard, “and I am now on
my way to his palace.”</p>

<p>“And how far off may that be?” asked Grimaçon.</p>

<p>“A half league,” was the reply.</p>

<p>As soon as he had reached the palace the old man
begged to be allowed to see the King, who, with the
Queen, his mother, was seated at his second breakfast.</p>

<p>The King, who was young, handsome, accomplished,
and a great monarch, desired that the wood-cutter
should be brought before him. When he
heard that a lovely maiden, with hair like the moon’s
rays, was asleep on the banks of a stream scarce half
a league distant, watched over by a dwarf, his curiosity
knew no bounds; so, having rewarded the venerable
man with a gold piece and a fricasseed goose from
the royal breakfast table, he commanded his chariot
to be brought, and was soon on his way to the banks
of the stream, accompanied by the Queen, his
mother, who was also dying to behold so wonderful
a sight.</p>

<p>When the Princess awoke some time afterwards,
what was her amazement on beholding a large body of
people, headed by a chariot of crystal, the wheels of
which were of silver and the cushions of velvet, and
which was drawn by six Spanish horses, advancing
towards her. In this equipage was seated a lady, magnificently
dressed, and a handsome young man, who,
stopping the chariot, desired the Princess and Grimaçon
to approach.</p>

<p>“Ah!” exclaimed the dwarf, “this is none other
than the King of the Crystal Mountains, Madame; let
us try to propitiate so great a monarch, for we are
completely in his power!”</p>

<p>So saying, he bowed till his back hair swept the
ground.</p>

<p>The Princess was then questioned by the Queen as to
who she was and where she had come from, but, as she
did not wish to give her real name, for fear that Blackwig
might by chance hear of her, Moonflower only
told their Majesties that she was a stranger, obliged to
fly from her country, and craved their protection. She
did not know that she was in a kingdom more than a
million leagues from her own, and, moreover, one of
which Blackwig knew nothing. He was an ignorant
fellow, and had forgotten all the history and geography
he had ever learnt.</p>

<p>“Your Majesties,” said the dwarf, “if it may be
permitted to one so humble to speak in such august
company, I would like to mention that we have had
no food for several days but the wild roots and berries
which grow here.”</p>

<p>The Queen, who had espied the Princess’s marvellous
hair, was enchanted with the sight, and at once thought
she would like to have her for a maid-of-honour.
“Such a person in my train would make me the
eighth wonder of the world,” she said to herself.</p>

<p>“Will you come back with me to the palace?” she
inquired aloud. “I will admit you into my household.”</p>

<p>Moonflower fell upon her knees and thanked her.</p>

<p>“Get into the chariot,” said the Queen, “and let us
be off!”</p>

<p>“But we must have him too,” said the King,
pointing to Grimaçon, “for he is a brave little fellow
and speaks well.” And he directed one of the men-at-arms
to place him before him on his horse.</p>

<p>“This is the second ride of the sort I have had
lately,” observed Grimaçon to himself, “but I think it
is likely to end better than the last!”</p>

<p>When they arrived at the palace the Princess was
appointed to a place among the Queen’s maids-of-honour;
they gave her a white satin gown covered with
golden lilies to match her hair, in which she looked
more beautiful and brilliant than the seven stars of
heaven. Grimaçon was still allowed to attend upon
her. The King had a great regard for him, and esteemed
his talents and good sense very highly.</p>

<p>The Queen’s maids had, upon the whole, a very
pleasant existence; it is true that she led them the
life of dogs now and then, for her temper was very bad,
and she was a proud, jealous woman. But, as the Court
was gay, they amused themselves capitally and joined
in all the festivities. They had balls three times a
week and hunting-parties every day. At the hunting-parties
Moonflower rode a magnificent strawberry-coloured
mare, with a silver bridle and shoes, while
Grimaçon ambled by her side on a huge mastiff, which
had been trained to carry him, and which he managed
to perfection.</p>

<p>The King was so much attracted by the lovely
Princess that he cared to speak to none but her. At
all the balls he chose her as his partner, and at all the
hunting-parties he rode beside her; but, unhappily, the
more his admiration for her increased, the more the
other maids-of-honour resented it, and spared no pains
in annoying and mortifying her.</p>

<p>“There is no living at court now that this wretched
Moonflower has come,” they said to one another; and
at last they determined to do their best to set the
Queen-mother against her.</p>

<p>“Madam,” they said to her, “your Majesty has no
idea of the intriguing character of your new maid;
we can hear the sly creature talking sometimes to her
miserable puppet of a dwarf, and we know that she is
plotting to become possessed of the King’s affections,
and intends to supplant your Majesty in the influence
you have always had with him.”</p>

<p>At these words the Queen turned pale. She was
furious.</p>

<p>She knew not upon what pretext she could injure
Moonflower, for she could find no fault with her sweet
temper and modest demeanour. That afternoon, as
the whole court was setting out upon a hunting expedition,
the Princess was about to mount her
horse at the palace-door as the Queen passed by in
her carriage.</p>

<p>“Why do you always ride that ugly brute?” called
out the Queen crossly, pointing to the strawberry-coloured
mare.</p>

<p>“Madam,” replied Moonflower, curtseying, “because
his Majesty, the King, presented me with the
animal.”</p>

<p>“Little wretch,” hissed the Queen between her
teeth, “she would ride a pig if the King asked her
to!” And she drove off in a fury.</p>

<p>The King was so much in love with Moonflower
that he could neither eat by day, nor sleep by night,
and, as soon as they came to that part of the forest
where they intended hunting, he rode beside her; he
never quitted her all day; he said a thousand tender
things to her; in fact, he was so devoted that
Grimaçon, who was trotting behind them on his
mastiff, was overjoyed, for he felt sure that the King,
as well as being an excellent <span class='it'>parti</span>, was worthy of her
in every respect.</p>

<p>When the Queen-mother heard of this, her rage
knew no bounds; she caused her chariot to be turned
and went straight home. To add to her troubles,
a heavy thunderstorm came on, and the rain drenched
her to the skin, so that, by the time she arrived at the
palace, she was almost beside herself. On the Princess’s
return that afternoon she was summoned to the
Queen’s apartments, where she found her Majesty in a
towering rage. She stormed and raved, she called her
by a thousand bad names, she would not hear a
word the poor girl had to say, and, at last, flung herself
upon a couch, breathless with anger.</p>

<p>“And what is the reason of your Majesty’s displeasure?”
inquired Moonflower, terrified. “May I be
informed of my offence?”</p>

<p>“Intriguing hussy!” cried the Queen, “you know
too well! But you will never be mistress here—the
King has too much sense to stoop to such an alliance!”</p>

<p>“Madam!” exclaimed Moonflower, “I do not
understand you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, indeed,” replied the Queen, ironically, “so
you don’t know what I mean. I mean that you are
trying to entangle the affections of my son, the King,
with your soft looks and sly ways; but, believe me,
such unmaidenly conduct will never succeed.”</p>

<p>When the Princess heard these cruel words she was
ready to die of mortification and misery, and her anger
against the Queen grew almost beyond her control.
“Ah!” she cried, “what a cruel position I am in, and
who is there that will help me?”</p>

<p>Then she suddenly bethought herself of the stream,
and, without waiting to reflect whether she was right
or wrong in her impulse, she cried,</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“River rise and river fall,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;Send the help for which I call.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>and, as she said this, she wished in her heart that the
stream might rise and drown the Queen.</p>

<p>Immediately a voice was heard to say, “Unhappy
Princess, why have you neglected my warning?” And
a fountain in the garden below the windows of the
Queen’s apartments began throwing itself higher and
higher into the air until it dashed against the casement,
breaking the glass, and pouring into the room.</p>

<p>The Queen rushed to the door as fast as she could,
tore it open and flew downstairs, followed by Moonflower.
But the water pursued them down the staircase
and into the garden. When it had reached thus far
it flowed across the terrace into the river which ran
below, leaving the garden dry, and the Queen shrieking
among the flower-beds, where all the beautiful
flowers—roses, lilies, tulips, marguerites and marigolds—were
torn up by the roots. Moonflower felt herself
carried away by the water; her cries and struggles
were of no avail, and, catching and clinging to every
object she passed, she was whirled away and very soon
lost consciousness. In this condition she floated along
the river for leagues and leagues, with her long hair
spread out like a fan behind her, to where it flowed
at the foot of the Crystal Mountains.</p>

<p>Here she awoke from her trance and found herself
being hurried swiftly forward towards a dark spot
visible in the base of one of the highest hills. She
drew closer and closer to it, but could not stop herself.
Picture her terror on finding, as she approached it, that
the dark spot proved to be the mouth of a huge
cavern! In another moment she had entered it and
was sinking down, down, down.</p>

<p>It was completely dark, and the water continued
transporting her into the very bowels of the earth. At
last, after what seemed to poor Moonflower several
hours, a faint light began to show itself far below her,
and to grow larger every moment, until the stream all
at once emerged from the darkness, and she found herself
in a wide and solitary marsh. She clung to some
rushes that grew at the water’s edge and dragged herself
out.</p>

<p>“Where am I?” she cried, “and what horrible
place is this in which I find myself? My last hope
is the enchanted leaf,”—and she put her hand
into her dress, but oh, horror! she had dropped it.
<span class='it'>Where?</span></p>

<p>She wept until she was weary, and then, as she
began to feel the pangs of hunger, she arose, and, looking
over the vast expanse of marsh, tried to see whether
there were any house or cottage where she might beg a
piece of bread and a lodging.</p>

<p>In the far distance she soon beheld a building,
toward which she directed her steps, and, after walking
for hours, she came to an enormous palace, built
entirely of mud. At the gate there lay a great
crocodile, at sight of which the Princess almost
fainted with fear; but, perceiving that the creature
was asleep, she timidly approached and rang the doorbell,
the handle of which was made of a crocodile’s
tooth.</p>

<p>Now, the country in which Moonflower found
herself belonged to a terrible and wicked Enchanter,
who lived there entirely by himself but for thousands
of crocodiles, which were his only companions,
and for which he had a singular fancy. When
he heard the bell ring he looked out, and saw the
Princess standing before the door, so he immediately
went down to meet her. When she beheld him
her terror increased a thousandfold, for he was indeed
more frightful than sin itself. He was clothed from
head to foot in the skins of crocodiles, and carried in
his hand a rod made of black wood, upon which was
represented a crocodile’s face. He had but one glaring
eye, and his mouth was furnished with huge pointed
teeth, which caused him to look fiercer than an ogre.
When he set eyes upon her he cried: “Ho! here
comes another mortal to add to my collection of
crocodiles!” And he raised his magic wand to change
her into one of these loathsome beasts, when, as he was
about to put his wicked design in practice, an idea
struck him. “No,” he said, “I am getting up in
years, and require some one to look after me; my
crocodiles are stupid brutes and perform the services of
my house but indifferently. Now here is a servant
ready to my hand.” So he dragged the terrified
Moonflower into his horrible palace, where he set her
to scrub the floors, wash the dishes, cook the food, and
perform the most menial offices. At night she had
only the bare boards to sleep on, and nothing to eat but
dried frogs.</p>

<p>In this way many days passed. All night she wept
and all day she worked hard. “Oh, if death would
but come to relieve me!” she sobbed, “what a blessing
it would be. But alas! he alone comes to those who
do not want him, and forgets wretches like myself.”</p>

<p>Now the Enchanter had a great glass tower on the
top of his house, on which was reflected everything
that took place on the marsh in which it stood, and
every day the Princess would go up and look out to
see if, by any chance, help might be approaching; and,
as day by day she came down disappointed, she began
to fear that she would have to spend the rest of her life
with the Enchanter and his hateful crocodiles. “If
I had but my dear Grimaçon,” thought she, “but alas!
how can he know where I am, and, even if he did,
how could he get here?”</p>

<p>We must now return to the palace of the King of
the Crystal Mountains.</p>

<p>When the flood caused by the fountain had subsided
and the Queen had been put to bed in hysterics, the
excitement somewhat calmed itself, and only the
dwarf went running about calling for the Princess.
When one of the servants informed him that she had
been carried away by the water his grief knew no
bounds. He sighed, he wept, he tore his hair, his cries
were heard all over the palace, where he wandered
about from room to room, giving way to his sorrow,
and at last he came to the room where the Queen and
his mistress had been talking at the time of the flood.
As he walked along, with his head bent, looking the
very picture of desolation, he caught sight of a little
dark thing lying on the floor. He picked it up.</p>

<p>It was the Enchanted Leaf, which had been dropped
by Princess Moonflower.</p>

<p>At the sight of this, which so forcibly brought back
to him her memory, his tears began to flow afresh.
He sat down upon the ground, looking at it, and
thinking of the late tragedy. Suddenly it occurred
to him that the Princess might not indeed be dead,
but that she had probably called upon the stream to
help her, and had been carried away by it. “Perhaps,”
conjectured the unhappy little creature, “she desired
its aid without a good reason, and has been overtaken
by the flood as a punishment. The voice warned her
of it. If so, I must seek her to the very ends of the
earth. Perhaps this leaf may be of service to me also,
for, though I am not the Princess, I have her happiness
as much at heart as if I were.”</p>

<p>He then resolved to go to the King and to tell him
the whole story, concealing only the fact of Moonflower’s
high birth, which he had solemnly sworn not
to reveal without her permission. At that moment he
looked out of the window and perceived the King
walking about round the fountains and up and down
the terraces as one distracted. He tore his hair and
even his moustache. It was fortunate that the Queen,
his mother, was in bed and could not see him.</p>

<p>Grimaçon went out into the garden, and, with a low
bow, presented himself before the afflicted monarch.</p>

<p>“Ah!” cried the King. “My worthy Grimaçon,
what a blow is this! Alas! alas! how terrible to
think that Moonflower is drowned!”</p>

<p>“Take courage, your Majesty,” replied the dwarf.
“I hope that we may yet behold her again.”</p>

<p>And he told the King of the Crystal Mountains the
whole story, craving his Majesty’s permission to go in
search of his dear mistress.</p>

<p>“Go! go!” exclaimed the King, “most excellent
dwarf, and I will go with thee. We will seek her
together, though we should traverse the whole
universe.”</p>

<p>When the Queen heard that her son was about to
depart on a long journey accompanied by the dwarf,
she was furiously angry, for she guessed that they were
going to look for Moonflower. But she was soon
appeased, as she was to have the management of the
kingdom during the King’s absence.</p>

<p>The King and Grimaçon started quite alone, the
King taking nothing with him but a sword which
he had inherited from his grandfather, and which he
thought might bring him luck. The hilt was made
of a single topaz, and the blade was of such superfine
Damascus steel, that when it was forged it was considered
the eighth wonder of the world. The dwarf
carried with him nothing but the Enchanted Leaf.</p>

<p>“I think, your Majesty,” he observed, “that we
shall do well to follow the course of the stream that
has taken Moonflower away; and if so, we will have
recourse to this.”</p>

<p>And he pulled the Enchanted Leaf out of his pocket,
and, touching it with the third finger of his left hand,
he thought of the old woman who had given it to the
Princess, wondering whether it would be of the same
use to him as it had been to her.</p>

<p>Instantly it began to grow larger and larger, until it
became big enough for the King and Grimaçon to sit
upon it. In another moment they were being whirled
onward upon the face of the water.</p>

<p>“Now that we are fairly launched,” observed the
dwarf, “I am sure that your Majesty has never travelled
in this way before and with such a companion.”</p>

<p>“As to the travelling,” answered the King, “I would
put up with anything in order to reach Moonflower;
and I shall indeed do well if I never start upon an
enterprise with a less brave and loyal friend.”</p>

<p>The dwarf was greatly pleased at finding himself so
much esteemed by the King, and, as they sailed along,
his heart grew lighter, for he felt sure that they would
find the lost Princess some day.</p>

<p>They journeyed on, stopping here and there to
gather the fruits that grew on the banks, and at
night resting at the water-side, for the King, being
strong, they were able to stop their boat and pull
it ashore. After a weary journey they saw in front
of them the same dark spot that Moonflower had
remarked at the foot of the Crystal Mountains. When
they became aware that it was a deep cavern towards
which they were rushing, they were rather startled.</p>

<p>“Well, well,” sighed the King, “if she has perished,
let us also perish, and in the same manner.”</p>

<p>When they entered the mouth of the hole and found
themselves sliding down, down, down, deeper and
deeper, even Grimaçon grew frightened, and held
tightly to his Majesty’s doublet.</p>

<p>At last they beheld a tiny speck of light shining far
below them.</p>

<p>“Courage, Grimaçon,” exclaimed the King, “For I
see a light.”</p>

<p>Here the dwarf peered round the King’s elbow (for
he was seated behind him), and, when he saw the little
spark, he felt that, after all, fortune might yet permit
them to land somewhere in safety.</p>

<p>At last they came out, as Moonflower had done, into
the lonely marsh.</p>

<p>The stream sailed on, but much more slowly, and
the King and his companion began to find the leaf on
which they sat decreasing in size. “I feel sure that it
is a sign of our voyage being at an end,” said
Grimaçon.</p>

<p>The King stepped into the shallow water, picked up
Grimaçon, and set him on the bank, drawing the leaf
up after him. It immediately shrank to its natural
size, upon which his Majesty gave it to the dwarf, who
put it in his pocket. As they sat resting upon the
bank they espied the Enchanter’s mud palace towering
in the distance and resolved to go there, hoping to find
some one who might give them news of the object of
their search.</p>

<p>They walked and walked across the wet marsh,
stumbling and sinking in the slimy mud, until the
dwarf grew so tired that he could go forward no
longer.</p>

<p>“I can go no further, sire,” he exclaimed, “and
your Majesty must go on and leave me; I do
not fear death now that I am robbed of my dear
mistress.”</p>

<p>But the King would not hear of such a thing, and,
being a strong man, he took him on his back and proceeded
onward as best he might, for Grimaçon was
no light weight, on account of the hump on his
back, which made its owner as heavy as an ordinary
person.</p>

<p>Now it happened at that moment, that Moonflower
was looking out of the Enchanter’s glass tower, and
saw, in the far distance, a man advancing with something
on his back. With the exception of her wicked
jailer, she had seen no one since she came to his house
but the hideous reptiles which surrounded it, and her
heart leaped with joy.</p>

<p>Picture her transports of delight on beholding, as
they approached, that they were none other than the
King of the Crystal Mountains and Grimaçon!</p>

<p>“But,” she thought, bursting into tears, “the dreadful
Enchanter will but turn them into crocodiles as
soon as he sees them!”</p>

<p>She flew downstairs and met the King and the dwarf
at the door.</p>

<p>The crocodile which was lying across the threshold
snapped his horrible teeth at them as they advanced,
but, drawing his sword, the King pierced him to the
heart, when, to the intense astonishment of the
Princess and her rescuers, he at once became a young
man.</p>

<p>“How can I thank you?” he exclaimed, embracing
the King. “You have liberated me from a frightful
prison.”</p>

<p>And he explained to them how the Enchanter, by a
touch of his black wand, had transformed him into a
crocodile, until he should be released by the sword of a
fellow mortal.</p>

<p>“But,” he continued, “he will do the same to you,
if he gets near enough to strike you also.”</p>

<p>At this moment the Enchanter, who, during this
conversation, had been asleep indoors, came out with
the fatal wand in his hand. With a howl of rage, he
rushed towards them, but, in so doing, he fell over the
carcase of the crocodile and his wand slipped from
his fingers. He stretched out his hand to catch
it, but Grimaçon was too quick for him, and, seizing
the little rod, he broke it into a thousand pieces
and scattered them to the four winds of heaven.
The King waited until his enemy rose, upon which,
drawing his sword, he fell upon him. A deadly combat
then ensued, for the cruel monster had a club made of
crocodiles’ bones, which he used with great skill and
with which he laid about him like a madman.</p>

<p>But, at last, he sank, mortally wounded by the topaz-hilted
sword, and expired at the King’s feet. At the
same moment a shout of joy was heard, and all the
crocodiles appeared in their true shapes, for the
Enchanter’s death had set them free from their captivity.</p>

<p>There were upwards of a thousand beautiful youths
and maidens, who had, at one time or another, fallen
into the stream and been carried down through the
cavern into these dark and awful dominions.</p>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<p><span class='pageno' title='96' id='Page_96'></span></p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/096.jpg' alt='sword fight' id='iid-0008' style='width:80%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<p>The King then fell upon his knees before Moonflower
and implored her to become his wife. The
dwarf added his entreaties to those of his Majesty,
and the Princess promised that, if they lived to reach
the kingdom of the Crystal Mountains, she would
bestow upon him her heart and her hand.</p>

<p>So they started for the cavern’s mouth, followed by
the troop of those rescued from the Enchanter’s
malice.</p>

<p>When they had traversed the marsh they heard a
sound like thunder, and, looking back, perceived that
the mud palace had sunk into the earth, and that, in
its place, there had arisen a grove of palm-trees the
stems of which were of gold and the leaves of
emeralds.</p>

<p>The marsh, too, had changed its aspect in a very
wonderful manner. The brackish water had become as
clear as amber, golden fish darted about in it and shot
to and fro among the rushes, which were of crystal
and aquamarines. A thousand will-o’-the-wisps with
diamond lanterns flashed about and the air was full of
the songs of birds.</p>

<p>At the cavern’s mouth they stopped, not knowing
how to go on, when Grimaçon took the Enchanted
Leaf from his pocket and gave it to Moonflower. She
touched it, and behold, it blazed up like a star in her
hand, throwing light into the mouth of the cave and
illuminating the falling water. Then they observed
a little staircase cut in the rock which wound upwards,
ascending high out of their sight. It had
a crystal balustrade which made the ascent quite easy,
and in a few moments they were all on their way
up it.</p>

<p>It took them two days to reach the top and the poor
Princess nearly fainted with weariness, but, supported
by the King, she at last accomplished it, after which
they sat down to rest awhile at the foot of the Crystal
Mountains.</p>

<p>All at once they perceived flying towards them in
the air two magnificent chariots, so glorious and
brilliant that never, in the whole world, had anything
appeared like them.</p>

<p>The first was drawn by twenty silver swans. In it
sat a lady from the border of whose cloak hung fringes
of pearls and jacinths. She alighted on the ground,
close by the Princess, who, pale with astonishment, was
watching the second chariot approaching. This was
drawn by twelve peacocks, and made entirely of
emeralds. It was driven by the most lovely lady
imaginable, no less gorgeous than her companion,
wearing a crown of opals which shone like the stars
on a summer night.</p>

<p>The two Fairies stepped out of their chariots, and
thus addressed the astonished King:</p>

<p>“This,” they said, pointing to the Princess, “is the
Princess Moonflower, daughter of a rich and powerful
sovereign now dead. She has been compelled to fly
from her kingdom by her wicked aunt, who has
usurped the throne.”</p>

<p>“I am the Fairy of Rivers and Streams,” continued
the lady who had first arrived, “and, as she once did
a kindness to a subject of mine, I have protected her;
and, had she not disregarded a warning I gave her,
these late troubles would never have taken place.”</p>

<p>The Princess fell upon her knees and craved the
Fairy’s pardon for her folly.</p>

<p>“Rise,” answered she, lifting her, “you have, with
the King’s help, overcome your difficulties, and you
certainly ought to make him happy.”</p>

<p>The other Fairy then came forward.</p>

<p>“Moonflower,” she said, “I am the Fairy of the
Green Woods, and it was I, in the guise of an old hag,
whom you so graciously conducted on my way. It
was I who gave you the Enchanted Leaf, which you
must always keep as an heirloom in your family; and
now, I beg of you to marry this brave and devoted
monarch, who seeks your hand.”</p>

<p>At these words the Princess embraced the two
Fairies, who invited her, with the King and Grimaçon,
to go with them to the palace of the King. The
released youths and maidens then dispersed to their
several homes, and, mounting the chariot of the Fairy
of the Green Woods, Moonflower soon reached the
palace, followed by the King and the dwarf, who
accompanied the other Fairy.</p>

<p>The nuptials of the King of the Crystal Mountains
and Princess Moonflower were soon afterwards solemnised,
and the two Fairies honoured the festivities with
their presence; all those who had been rescued from
the Enchanter’s cruelty by the King were invited, and
the rejoicings lasted for twenty days, after which his
Majesty made war upon the Princess’s aunt, and recovered
her kingdom, killing the wicked Blackwig
with his own hand.</p>

<p>A terrible fate was in store for the King’s proud
and cruel mother. On the day of her son’s marriage
she was returning in her chariot from the
ceremony, much mortified and incensed by what had
just taken place. Noticing, as she drove along, that
her coachman had not brought out the team of horses
she had ordered, and being already furious, she leaned
forward to strike him with the golden sceptre in her
hand, and, in so doing, overbalanced herself, and fell
under the chariot-wheels, where she was almost crushed
to death. She was conveyed to the palace with all
speed, but, before she reached her apartments, she
expired, muttering vengeance against everyone.</p>

<p>The fate of the dwarf Grimaçon was very different.
He was made Prime Minister and was the most
honoured person in the King’s dominions. The King
and Queen never took any step without first consulting
him, and he lived to an advanced age beloved by all,
but especially by their Majesties, who went to visit
him every day in a magnificent palace which they
built for him close by their own.</p>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<div><span class='pageno' title='102' id='Page_102'></span><h1>THE DOVECOTE</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>I</span>n</span> a wide stretch of pasture, in the middle of a
lonely field, with its back to the bleak north
blast which swept over the shuddering grasses,
making them hum and sing like complaining
voices, stood a Dovecote. The solid masonry
of its walls, in the crevices of which tufts of
stone-crop and shepherd’s purse had sown themselves,
and the irregular outlines of the crow-steps
which ran up either side of its slanting
roof had been familiar to the sight of so many
generations that, as it had remained unused
within the memory of the oldest, no one
thought more of it than if it had been a stone-heap
in the road, nor noticed the curious fact of its
never falling into disrepair. At each end of the roof,
above the crow-steps, two large stone balls stood out
against the sky, and on these the rooks, going home in
the red sunsets to a neighbouring rookery, perched from
year’s end to year’s end, and no one but themselves, or
a few inquisitive sheep, who might rub their woolly
heads against the walls, seemed to remember the
existence of the solitary building. At some little
distance behind it the land rose in a steep slope, rolling
upwards to where a fringe of fir-trees looked down
upon the Dovecote, the fields, and the scattered
habitations below.</p>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<p><a id='dove'></a></p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/102.jpg' alt='small building in a hilly field' id='iid-0009' style='width:80%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<p>Anyone standing beside them might see over a vast
area of land. Looking to the west, the hills rose in
bold relief, and towards them ran a white road which
lost itself now and then, only to reappear in patches till
it faded into the distance; looking eastward, there lay
spread a long stretch of wooded country, over which
the lights and shadows floated and the clouds sailed
before the west wind on their way to the sea, which
could be seen on a sunny day lying like a blue sapphire
upon the horizon. Looking straight southward
towards the pastures, the sloping ground at the foot of
the trees was all one fertile cornfield, as yet uncut, and,
half way up it, where the hill was steepest, stood three
elms, growing close together and making a dark spot of
shade in the middle of the yellow grain. These were
called “Maddy Norey’s trees.” What Maddy Norey’s
history had been no one alive knew, but tradition said
that she had lived in a small cottage under the shadow
of the elms, and men ploughing the field in the late
November days had run their ploughshares against
deeply-embedded stones at their roots, and told each
other that they had struck the foundations of Maddy
Norey’s house. They did not know that the witch,
Maddy Norey, was alive still, and living hardly out of
the sound of their voices in the Dovecote.</p>

<p>But in spite of the lonely quiet of the old place, and
the peace which seemed to brood over the standing
corn, there was war and strife in the land. The young
King, with his Queen, had been forced to fly from his
palace, a fugitive and wanderer, not knowing where to
seek shelter for his head; his step-brother, a wicked
and unscrupulous man, having, with his plots and
cunning and his smooth, lying tongue, stirred up the
people in revolt against their sovereign. Through
the treachery of some of the soldiery the palace gates
had been broken down, the King’s capital was in the
hands of the mob, and he and the Queen had made
their escape, trying to reach the distant sea-board, and
from it to take ship across the Northern Sea to a
neighbouring land ruled by one of their closest allies.</p>

<p>Under cover of night they fled through the streets of
the capital, passing unnoticed in the confusion, and
slipping through the city gates deserted by the
treacherous guards. Once in the open country, they
hid themselves in the woods by day, and travelled
forward on foot by night, hoping against hope to
elude the pursuers sent out after their flight had
become known, and to reach the nearest point of
coast from which they might set sail for the friendly
land opposite.</p>

<p>At last, after many days, they came to a place only a
few dozen miles inland, and the King, who knew the
country well, encouraged the weary Queen, telling her
how short a space lay between them and the sea.
They were on the borders of a birch-wood through
which they had travelled all night, and, as they came
out and saw the wide pasture stretched before them in
the early light (for it was dawning) the Queen sank
down on the ground, worn out, declaring that she
could go no further.</p>

<p>At this the King was in despair, for day was
breaking and there seemed to be no place of safety in
which they could conceal themselves until night should
come round again and cover the two lonely wanderers
with her dark curtain.</p>

<p>“Lie still and rest,” said he, as he drew off his
cloak and spread it over his wife, “I will go a little
way forward and find some place in which we
can shelter for to-day. Do not move until I come
back. I shall not be long away.” And he wandered
off into the field towards a strange pile of building
which he saw rising like a watch-tower from the level
plain.</p>

<p>When he reached it he found it to be a deserted
Dovecote, and he walked round it, wondering why such
a solid structure had been built for the harbouring of
a few doves and pigeons.</p>

<p>As he passed round the north side he came upon a
wooden door, so low that a man entering would be
obliged to bend himself almost double, and he cleared
away the nettles and tufts of ragwort which grew by
the threshold, pushing with his shoulder against the
half-rotten wood. The door opened easily.</p>

<p>The Dovecote was quite dark inside, and only the
light from the open door behind him enabled the King
to see a crazy staircase running up the side of the
wall to what was apparently a room overhead. As he
stood irresolute whether or not to venture up, another
little door opened at the top of the flight and the bent
form of an old woman peered out, illuminated by the
sky-light in the ceiling of the room she had just left.
The King stood amazed.</p>

<p>“And so you have come at last,” she said, in a voice
which seemed far too soft to proceed from such a
crooked body, “and why have you not brought the
Queen? Do not be afraid,” she added, seeing the look
of consternation on his face, “I have expected you for
some time. I am Maddy Norey, and I have lived here
for more years than you and the Queen put together
could count if your ages were doubled twice over.
Go at once and bring her back with you, for here she
can find a safe hiding-place.”</p>

<p>The astonished King could only lean against the wall,
and stare up at the strange figure above him.</p>

<p>“Go!” cried the old woman, stamping on the
floor.</p>

<p>He turned to obey her, and began groping for the
little door by which he had entered; but the more he
went from wall to wall, the more amazed was he, for
there was no sign nor vestige of such a thing.</p>

<p>Maddy Norey laughed softly.</p>

<p>“Now,” she said, “do you see how safe a castle mine
is? If I had not chosen that you should see my door
you might still be wandering round the walls among
the briars outside. Is not this a safe retreat for the
Queen?”</p>

<p>“Let me go, Maddy Norey, and bring her to you.”
And as the King said this he perceived the open door
close to him, with the sun’s early beams shooting
through like golden lances and striking the cobwebs
which hung from the lintel.</p>

<p>A short time later saw him standing in the birch-wood
by the side of the Queen, who had fallen asleep
from exhaustion among the silver stems. The leaves
quivered in the breath of sunrise as they emerged
together from the wood and took their way to the
Dovecote. The wooden door was open to receive them,
and Maddy Norey was at the top of her stair,
peering down upon the Queen as she ascended,
weary and faint, with her beautiful dark hair, which
had slipped from its golden comb, falling in masses
over her cloak.</p>

<p>“Now,” said the old woman, when they had reached
her attic, “look round at my house and tell me what
you think of it.”</p>

<p>The King and Queen were silent, for they knew not
what to say. They saw nothing but a small bare room
with a sky-light in the roof. The light was struggling
in among the cobwebs and a cold air blew through the
little row of holes among the tiles, by which bygone
flocks of pigeons had entered to roost, or emerged to
plume themselves in artless vanity on the slanting roof
and the crow-steps outside. An oaken three-legged
stool stood in one corner with an old-fashioned spinning-wheel
beside it, and this was the only furniture or
sign of a human inhabitant visible in the little attic.</p>

<p>Maddy Norey smiled.</p>

<p>“I can see your thoughts,” she said, turning to the
King. “But you must not think that I have made no
better preparation for the Queen than this. I know a
great deal. I know that she will spend much time
with me here, and I have arranged all that I can to
help you in the time that is coming. Now look into
that dark spot in the wall and tell me whether I have
not prepared my house well for you.”</p>

</div>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<p>As she said this she raised her bent figure and spread
out her arms widely. A thin blue mist drove across
their vision like a smoke-cloud, and through it broke
a glow as of burning coals. It rolled past them,
leaving only a faint vapour, behind which they could
see a thick hedge of fiery-hearted roses that seemed to
burn like living embers. Through a division in the
midst of this radiant tangle the light from the glowing
flowers shone upon a floor and walls of black oak
which could be seen behind it, reflecting itself in the
polished darkness beyond, as stars reflect themselves
in deep water; and, at the further end of the room, in
an angle where the dark walls met, stood a bed carved
with designs which could be only dimly seen, and hung
with curtains of a rich deep colour that might have
been either green or blue.</p>

<p>Then Maddy Norey took the Queen by the hand and
led her through the roses into the soft darkness. She
combed out her long hair, took from her her travel-stained
garments, and made her lie down in the carved
bed. Then her weary head sank back upon the
pillows, her tired eyes closed, and she drifted away
into a dreamless sleep under the blue hangings.</p>

<p>The King and Maddy Norey sat talking in the little
dusty attic all that day and far into the evening. His
gratitude knew no bounds when she said that he might
leave his wife in her charge while he pursued his
journey.</p>

<p>“When you arrive at the sea-shore,” she told him,
“you will find a boat lying on the sand; you must
manage so that you get there in two days from now,
and during the night-time, when the fisherman to
whom it belongs has gone home from fishing, and you
must take the oars and row straight out to sea. You
will find food and water for three days stored in the
boat, for the owner is going a journey in it to an island
some way off.”</p>

<p>“Maddy Norey,” said the young man, “promise
me that you will care for the Queen.”</p>

<p>“I will,” answered the old woman, holding out her
wrinkled hand. “But be advised, O King, and spare
her the parting, for it may be a long parting, and even
I do not know the end of it. She will never consent
to let you go alone, which, by reason of the hardships
you may have to undergo, is necessary. I might have
to prevent her from going with you by not allowing
her to find the door. Surely you will spare her
this? Look,” and she pointed to the darkening
sky-light, “it will soon be night, and there is no
moon. Go <span class='it'>now</span>—at once. By to-morrow morning
you will be many miles on your way, and if you
conceal yourself during the day, another night’s
travelling will bring you to the shore. Go; it
is best.”</p>

<p>The King stood up.</p>

<p>“I may go in and look at her?” he said.</p>

<p>Maddy Norey nodded. “I will not wake her,”
said he, “it would be too cruel.”</p>

<p>There was silence in the Dovecote for a few
minutes before the King re-appeared. He made a
sign of farewell to Maddy Norey and went down the
rickety stairs, through the wooden door and out into
the night alone.</p>

<p>When the Queen awoke next morning and found that
he had gone, her heart seemed broken, and she lay
weeping quietly in her carved bed.</p>

<p>“Why did I not awake when he came to say good-bye?”
she sobbed in despair to Maddy Norey, who
was sitting by her.</p>

<p>“My dear,” said the old woman, who did not tell
her that she had caused her to sleep so soundly on
purpose, “it was better it should be so, for it helped
the King through it. And he hoped that you would be
strong and keep a brave heart. You must summon all
your courage and be helpful to him when he returns,
for we do not know how soon that may be.”</p>

<p>With such words did Maddy Norey comfort the
Queen. And she, when the first freshness of her grief
was over, tried with all her strength to be cheerful
and affectionate to the old woman who had done so
much for them both. But every evening she used to
steal away to a dark corner to weep a little and think
of the King, perhaps still in hiding near the bleak
coast, perhaps tossing alone on the sea.</p>

<p>When several days had gone by the Queen began
to feel the monotony of her life very much, and to
long with a great longing for the fresh air, as she
dwelt in the cramped seclusion of the Dovecote.
It was impossible that she should venture out alone,
even for the smallest distance, in the rebellious state
of the country, more especially as the search for the
fugitive pair was still going on. But her strength and
spirits were declining daily, and Maddy Norey began
to fear that the confinement was telling upon her.
One evening as they sat within the windowless walls
which surrounded them, the Queen laid her hand on
the witch’s knee.</p>

<p>“If I could only have one breath of air,” she
sighed, “and one look at the fields and the sky. May
I go to the door and out for just a short, short way
into the pasture?”</p>

<p>“No,” she answered, “you must not do that. I
have to remember my promise to the King to keep
you in safety. But I can do this. To-morrow I
will work a spell upon you. I will turn you into a
white pigeon, whose presence, were it noticed about
the old place, would seem but natural. So long as
you remain standing on your feet or touch the ground
in any way, you will be a woman; but, if you make
ever so small a spring upwards, the moment your feet
leave the earth you will become a white bird, and
you may fly for a little distance round the Dovecote,
though I do not wish you to go far away. There is a
clump of elm-trees in the cornfield which runs up
the hill-side, and to them you may go, hiding yourself
among the branches, and returning here should
you find yourself noticed by even the most insignificant
passer-by.”</p>

<p>On the following day, accordingly, Maddy Norey
took from a recess behind the blue-green bed hangings
a strangely-shaped goblet which had two crystal wings
springing from either side; into this she shook a
powder which smelt aromatically; then she cut off
the head of one of the burning roses and threw it upon
the top. A subtle perfumed smoke rose and filled the
room, blinding the eyes of the Queen. She felt her
senses going from her, and clung to the witch’s protecting
arm. She heard her repeating to herself a slow,
monotonous rhyme:—</p>

</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p>As the words ceased she swooned away, and when
she came to herself, she was lying upon the attic floor
with the air from the open sky-light blowing in, and
Maddy Norey bending over her. She rose, rubbing
her eyes.</p>

<p>“Now,” said the old woman, “spring from the
ground.”</p>

<p>The Queen obeyed, and in an instant was standing
on the window-sill in the flashing sunbeams, a pure
white pigeon. She looked at the cornfield sloping
away northward, and at the green clump of elms
standing rich and heavy in the still heat, then spread
out her new-found pinions and sailed away towards
them.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p>Now, one day, as the white pigeon sat among the
elm-boughs, her eyes wandered over the slope of golden
grain to where the fir-trees stood on the top of the hill;
for she knew that from that place could be seen a far
wider view, and one that stretched away to the coast
and the ocean. What would she not give to have but
one glance at the distant leagues of water, one possible
chance of seeing some sign of hope on the horizon!
She thought of how Maddy Norey, the witch, had
commanded her to go no further than the three elms;
but she thought also of the aching, unsatisfied heart she
would carry back to the Dovecote if she obeyed her.
The temptation was too strong for her, and she finally
looked out from her shelter, and, seeing nothing living
but a few sheep grazing in the mid-day sun, flew upwards
over the corn and alighted on one of the topmost
branches of the firs. Then she turned her eyes eastward
and almost fell from her resting-place.</p>

<p>For the blue sea was all alive with white sails—the
sails of a great fleet advancing in a double line to the
land.</p>

<p>Prudence, her promise to Maddy Norey and her own
safety were alike forgotten; all that she could think of
was those approaching vessels which would so soon be
landing, and, without fear or hesitation, she spread her
wings, and in a moment was flying madly seawards.
Over the woods she sped, over the plains and marshes,
only now and then passing above a solitary dwelling in
the thinly-populated country she crossed. Sometimes
she saw a little knot of soldiers encamped in secluded
places, and guessed that they were the scouts posted
about by the rebels to watch for and capture their
sovereign. With a thankful heart she observed that,
being stationed in low-lying parts of the country
and among the woods, they could not see the sight
which she saw from the height at which she flew.
It was evident that none suspected the King of having
left the country. She hastened forward with redoubled
speed as the space between the fleet and the sea-shore
lessened. Just before sunset she had almost reached
the coast on which the ships were already landing,
and could plainly see boats rowing to the shore to
empty upon it their loads of armed warriors and going
back again to return with more. The sands were black
with hurrying figures.</p>

<p>All at once, below her there rose a shout from a
watchman who had been climbing to a greater eminence
than the others, and, realising that in an hour the
country might be up in arms, she strained every
nerve to reach her husband in time to prepare him for
an attack.</p>

<p>Scarcely a mile lay between her and the invading
army; she was thinking how, in another few moments,
she would be once more with the King, when a man,
loitering about on the waste land with his crossbow saw
the bird passing over his head, took an arrow from the
quiver and fitted it to the string. He was a good
marksman.</p>

<p>Suddenly a shock of pain passed through the white
pigeon and the earth seemed to rise up to meet her;
then a giddiness, a drop, and a heavy blow, and she was
lying on the wet ground, no longer a bird, but a terrified
and wounded woman with an arrow sticking in her arm.
Her wing had been broken.</p>

<p>She raised herself a little and saw that her persecutor
was rushing forward, and, as the remembrance of
her mission came back, she staggered to her feet
and tore the arrow from her arm. She was so near
safety and succour—so near—she <span class='it'>must</span> make one more
effort; gathering all her strength together, she bounded
on, half faint from loss of blood.</p>

<p>As the King stood on a green mound giving orders
for the encampment of his army, he heard a sound of
rushing footsteps and turned round. A woman with
flying hair and outstretched hands was dashing towards
him, through the sea-grass, through the stones and
driftwood, and, as she fell fainting at his feet, he
recognised the Queen.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p>The King and his wife sat in the royal tent together.
Her arm was stiff and painful and the King was uneasy,
for he longed to place her under more skilful care
than any which could be got in their present position.
They sat at the tent door under the stars; just before
morning, when all was beginning to be astir with
preparations for the march, a star dropped from its
place and fell across the Northern heavens. It travelled
slowly along, leaving in its wake a little train of blue
sparks.</p>

<p>“That is a good omen,” the Queen said.</p>

<p>Soon the rebels got news that the King had
landed, and they came with their troops to meet him.
There was a great battle that lasted from noon until
the evening, and all day the King rode unharmed through
the fray with a white pigeon on his shoulder—a white
pigeon with a broken wing. The enemy looked upon
this strange sight with superstitious awe, and many an
arrow tried to find its way to the mysterious bird’s
heart. But none succeeded, and when, at the end of
that hard day, the King stood victorious on the field,
the only signs of blood to be seen upon him were the
drops that dripped upon his shoulder from the wing of
the white pigeon.</p>

<p>At last he was able to go to his tent and lay aside
sword and armour, and he placed the bird tenderly
upon the ground. The Queen at once returned to her
own shape, half dead with pain and fatigue and scarcely
able to stand.</p>

<p>A great fear took hold upon the King. How if he
were even now, in the hour of his success, to lose
her?</p>

<p>It took him but one moment to make up his mind.
He would take her to Maddy Norey, for, if there were
help to be found under heaven, he knew that the witch
would give it to him.</p>

<p>Commanding a fresh horse should be brought, he
mounted as the moon rose and rode out into the
night, holding the bird in the folds of his cloak.
The people, when they heard of the advance of the
troops and the great defeat from some fugitives who
had escaped from the battle, had abandoned their
houses and fled in all directions, so it was through a
desolate country that the King spurred his good
horse. He rode grimly on with his sword drawn in
his hand, ready to cut down the first obstacle that
might present itself, his eyes fixed steadily in front of
him, looking neither to the right nor the left. In the
early dawn he stood, as he had stood not so long
since, at the foot of the Dovecote. There was the
little door in front of him, with its rusty latch and
hanging cobwebs. He threw himself from the saddle
and rushed into the building and up the crazy stair.
Maddy Norey’s voice came from inside the attic.</p>

<p>“Be quick, be quick,” she said, holding out her
hands for the bird, “you have not come a moment too
soon. Give her to me.”</p>

<p>They laid the fluttering creature on the ground, and,
when her natural shape had returned, the Queen was
carried to the carved bed where the witch dressed her
wound, and, with charms and spells, charmed back her
sinking life; and, having been assured by the old
woman that all danger was past, the King left her
with hope in his heart, and returned to meet his
troops.</p>

<p>From that day everything went well; the march to
the capital was but a triumphal progress, and the
victors were soon joined by bands of those who had
remained loyal during the rebellion, but who had not
been able to gain the day for their sovereign by
reason of the tremendous odds against which they
fought.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p>The cornfield below Maddy Norey’s trees had been
cut, the stooks were standing on the hill-side, and the
elm-trees were beginning to be faintly touched with
autumn, when, one blue, misty morning, the King
rode through the pastures to fetch the Queen. He
came alone, leading a grey horse by the bridle;
and he tied the two animals to an iron ring in the
Dovecote wall while he went up to the witch’s
attic.</p>

<p>He found the old woman at her spinning-wheel
with the young one beside her.</p>

<p>“When he comes to fetch me,” the Queen was
saying, “you will leave the Dovecote, will you not, dear
Maddy Norey, and come with us? For our home
shall be yours. You have been so good to us that we
cannot bear to part from you. Say that you will
come.”</p>

<p>“No,” said the witch, “it is impossible. I have
lived in this room for such countless years that I can
never leave it now. When you have gone no one
will ever find the little door again.”</p>

<p>And nothing that they could say would make her
consent.</p>

<p>So they went down the wooden stair together, and
Maddy Norey came to the top to bid them farewell.
For one moment she laid her hand on the King’s
curling hair as he bent over her wrinkled figure, and
she kissed the Queen, who threw her arms around her
crooked neck; then she stood a little space at the head
of the stair, looking at the two bright figures as they
went out from her into the light.</p>

<p>At the threshold they turned and saw that she was
holding up her hands as if in blessing.</p>

<p>Very silently they rode out of the pasture, and, as
they were about to turn the corner of the birch-wood,
they reined in their horses to take a last look at the curious
old building as it stood solitary in the morning mist.</p>

<p>There were tears in the Queen’s eyes.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='122' id='Page_122'></span><h1>THE PEACOCK’S TAIL</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>T</span>here</span> was once a widow of respectable family
who lived in a house in a retired part of the
country. Her only companion was her daughter,
Ella, who was exceedingly beautiful, and continually
on the look-out to see whether a
wandering prince would come by and marry
her.</p>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<p><a id='tail'></a></p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/122.jpg' alt='woman wearing a dress with a peacock feather train walking under a tree' id='iid-0011' style='width:80%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<p>There was also an old witch called Mother
Grindle, who lived up a tree in the orchard. A
deep pool was at the foot of this orchard, but
in spring the sight of the water was almost
shut out by the mass of blossom which covered
the apple-trees. There was a peacock, too, who
strutted about all day; he was not a bad fellow
really, but intolerably vain. Only one thing in the
place was vainer than himself, and that was Ella, the
widow’s daughter. Mother Grindle and the peacock
got on very well together, though the witch would
sometimes laugh and rock about till the tree shook,
which annoyed him very much. It was most odd.</p>

<p>One day he was walking along the grass; he took
very high steps, and sometimes he dragged his wings on
the ground. Then he would stop and set up his tail
like a fan behind him, arching and twisting his neck
in the sun. The apple-tree shook till the petals fell in
showers.</p>

<p>He looked up and saw Mother Grindle sitting in the
branches.</p>

<p>“Really!” he exclaimed. “A stranger might almost
think you were laughing at <span class='it'>me</span>!”</p>

<p>“What an idea!” said the witch, “you must be mad.”</p>

<p>So he went on trailing and prancing. The tree shook
again, and he could see Mother Grindle rocking from
side to side.</p>

<p>“What are you laughing at?” he cried. “It
can’t be me, because there is nothing about me to be
amused at. Now, if <span class='it'>I</span> were to start laughing at that
pointed hat you wear there would be some sense in it.”</p>

<p>At this moment Ella came out wearing her best
gown, for it was Sunday; she was not, as a rule, very
civil to Mother Grindle, for she also did not admire
the pointed hat. But she did admire the peacock. She
looked over her shoulder at her own train and was
forced to admit that, for colour and design, the
peacock’s tail far outdid it.</p>

<p>“Ah!” she sighed, “how I wish I had that tail.”</p>

<p>“You may have one wish—two wishes—three
wishes,” sang out Mother Grindle from the apple-tree.</p>

<p>And before you could say “Jack!” the beautiful tail
became fixed to Ella’s waist—eyes, moons, quills, fringes
and all.</p>

<p>“Now I am simply perfect,” said she; and she ran
to the hedge and looked over to see if a Prince were
coming down the road. But there was no one. As
for the peacock, he was furious, naturally.</p>

<p>Ella knew there was no mirror in the widow’s house
large enough to reflect her and all her glory, and she
went down to the pool and looked in at herself; she
stood on the edge and leaned over, putting up her tail
behind her head. All at once there came a gust and
caught it like the wind catching a sail; over she went,
straight in. It was very deep.</p>

<p>“Help! Help!” she cried. But there was no one
close by but the peacock, and <span class='it'>he</span> wasn’t going to put
himself out. He was delighted, and walked stiffly
away to the yard at the back of the house; he was
much consoled, and he knew very well that he would
grow a new tail next year.</p>

<p>“La! husband, how paltry you look!” cried the
peahens. They had long thought it rather hard that
he should be so much better dressed than themselves.</p>

<p>Ella screamed and shrieked. She caught hold of
some rushes, but the tail was so heavy that she could
not drag herself out.</p>

<p>“You shall have one wish—two wishes!” sang out
Mother Grindle from the tree.</p>

<p>“Oh! if I were only on shore!” cried Ella. And
sure enough she found herself standing on the brink,
dripping with water, but safe. She ran into the house
as fast as ever she could go.</p>

<p>She was put to bed at once in hot blankets. “How
you are to lie with that tail on, I can’t imagine,”
said her mother. However, in she got, arranging it
as best she might, and so tired was she after all she had
gone through, that she fell asleep and never woke till
the next morning.</p>

<p>She got up and dressed, but alas! alas! she had
rolled about in the night, and the beautiful feathers
were all broken and torn and matted together; they
hung like so many limp rags, and, do what she would,
she could not make them hang properly. She went
into the orchard, hoping that the sun and wind might
freshen them up; but though she spent some time in
taking out the tangles, the effect was horrid, and she
looked more draggle-tailed than words can say. The
peahens peeped over the fence and tittered.</p>

<p>At this moment a Prince came riding by, and saw her
walking in the orchard.</p>

<p>“Heavens! What an absurd sight!” he exclaimed,
as he rode on.</p>

<p>Ella sat down on the grass and cried bitterly.</p>

<p>“You may have one wish—one wish!” sang out the
witch from the tree.</p>

<p>“Oh! take away this dreadful thing,” sobbed Ella.</p>

<p>And before you could turn round it was gone. Then
Mother Grindle began to sing again very cheerfully.
But Ella was not cheerful—far from it.</p>

<p>“You may have one wish more—one wish more,”
sang the witch.</p>

<p>But Ella has not made up her mind what to ask for
yet. One cannot be too careful.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='127' id='Page_127'></span><h1>THE PELICAN</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>I</span>n</span> the land of Egypt, where the Nile runs and the
palm-trees grow and the great Sphynx sits alone
in the Desert, there lived a young man who kept
a jeweller’s shop in a crowded street. He was
tall and grave, and he wore a yellow kaftan
which clothed him from head to heel.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, when the street was full, he
would sit in front of his shop looking at the
people, and sometimes exchanging a word with
the passers-by.</p>

<p>It chanced that, as he sat in his accustomed
place one day, there passed a countryman carrying
under his arm a young Pelican, which he
had caught on the river. He held it very roughly,
and a crowd of boys followed behind jeering at the
strange, half-fledged creature, and sometimes pulling
its tail or its legs and laughing when it opened its
mouth in terror. Now the young man was angry that
the bird should be so used, for he had read many books
and thought many thoughts, and he knew that birds
and beasts had feelings like other people. He pitied
the poor frightened Pelican, and as one of the boys
passed, he gave him a great cuff which nearly knocked
him over.</p>

<p>“Good man,” said he to the countryman, “where
are you going with that Pelican?”</p>

<p>“To the other side of the city,” replied the countryman,
“where I know a man who will buy him and
cut his throat when he grows older for the sake of
his skin and feathers.”</p>

<p>“You need not go so far,” said the young man
in yellow, “for I myself will give you what price
you name for him.”</p>

<p>At this the countryman was glad enough, for he
was tired of carrying the bird, and the young man
paid him and took the poor Pelican into the court
behind his shop, where he put him down near a small
fountain in the middle of it.</p>

<p>As time went on, the Pelican grew so big that there
was scarce room for him in the little tank, and the
young man took him to sit in front of the shop.</p>

</div>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<p>One day, as they were there together, there passed
before them a girl carrying a basket of melons on her
head. She was slender, and her naked feet and ankles
were as fine as though she had been a great lady; she
had long, dark eyes, and the plait of her hair hung
down behind her, below the edge of her veil. With
one hand she drew the black folds over her mouth.</p>

<p>The young man in yellow was so much struck
that he could not refrain from speaking his thoughts
aloud. “That is the most charming girl I have ever
seen,” he said. “I wonder where she lives.”</p>

<p>“On the banks of the Nile some way down stream,”
said the Pelican, who was standing behind him.</p>

<p>At this, his master was so exceedingly astonished that
he nearly fell off his seat, for he never suspected that
the bird could talk.</p>

<p>“How do you know that?” he asked.</p>

<p>“There is a patch of brown Nile mud upon the
border of her garment,” replied the Pelican.</p>

<p>“That is very well,” said the other, “but how can
you tell what distance she comes from?”</p>

<p>“Her face is unveiled,” was the reply, “like those
of the women in the remoter country places.”</p>

<p>“And how do you know that her home is down
stream?” asked the young man again.</p>

<p>“Sir, I observed that the stems of the melons were
freshly cut, and must have been gathered this morning.
Those who bring melons to the town embark early, as
soon as their load is ready. Had the owner of these
lived up the river he would have arrived with his
merchandise before noon, being carried by the current.
But it is now afternoon.”</p>

<p>“You are a great reasoner,” exclaimed the young
man, “but how do you know that the girl has not been
in the city since morning?”</p>

<p>“Her basket is full,” answered the bird.</p>

<p>“Since you are so clever,” continued he, “perhaps
you will inform me if she often comes this way. I
have never seen her before.”</p>

<p>“Neither have I,” rejoined the Pelican, “but I can
answer, for all that. She draws the end of her veil over
her mouth as she goes; this is because she has seen much
of the ways of city women who veil themselves. You
may also have noticed that she turned under the gateway
by the mosque. Now that gateway is small and mean,
and only those acquainted with this street know that
there is a passage through it to the thoroughfare where
the cloth-merchants live; where every man is rich and
keeps a pile of melons behind his wares for the entertainment
of visitors. Doubtless she has been there
many a time.”</p>

<p>The young man was still more astonished. “I perceive,”
said he, “that one of the jewels in my shop is
the rare jewel of wisdom.”</p>

<p>At this the Pelican rejoiced in his heart. “Wisdom is
like other wildfowl, and roosts with its kind,” he replied.</p>

<p>“I perceive also that you have learnt to speak with
great civility,” continued the young man.</p>

<p>“Sir,” said the bird again, “while sitting here I
have observed the manners of the grave and reverend
persons who pass by, and of the aged sheikhs who
come on their donkeys to drink coffee with the merchant
opposite.”</p>

<p>After this the two lived together in great content
till, one day, the young man in yellow spoke his mind.</p>

<p>“Friend,” said he, “we have now been companions
for some time; but I must tell you I think this no suitable
life for a bird of your talents. You see nothing
of your own kind here, nor anything outside my shop.
It is time we began to think of your future. You
should marry and rear a family instead of sitting here.
Wisdom is good, but it is also portable, so you can
carry it away when you go. I have been thinking
this over, and I have found a good opening for you;
my uncle’s brother-in-law is keeper of the garden at
Prince Hassan’s palace outside the city. There, there
are great trees, lakes, islands, fruits, and a very high
family of Pelicans has been settled there for many
years. At my request you would be well received,
and you could then marry and live respectably. I
shall be grieved beyond measure at parting from you,
but, having your welfare at heart, I shall make up my
mind to it. Besides, I will go to see you regularly
every Friday.”</p>

<p>At first the bird was very unwilling to agree to this
plan, for he was much attached to his friend, but at
last he consented: and the young man hired an ass and
rode to Prince Hassan’s garden with the Pelican sitting
before him on the saddle. His uncle’s brother-in-law
received them warmly, and installed the Pelican on a
fine lake where there were islands covered with long
grass, and, at one side, a mass of tall scarlet flowers
standing by the banks with their roots in the water.</p>

<p>The Pelican was attracted by these beautiful plants
and made his home in their midst, having an eye for
colour; the life suited him but for one thing, and that
was the dull company which he found among the other
birds. He hardly cared to speak to them, for, though
they were civil and pleasant enough, he had been so
long accustomed to the talk of the young man in yellow
that all other seemed dull in comparison. As for
marrying, he gave up the idea, for he could not find
one hen-pelican whose silly chatter did not drive him
mad. In spite of the luxury in which he lived, he
counted the days of each week till Friday should come
round and bring his friend to sit with him for an hour
or two among the scarlet flowers.</p>

<p>Now it happened that the girl who sold melons, and
whom the young man in yellow had never seen since
the day on which the Pelican first spoke, was sitting
one afternoon by the Nile. The reason he had not
seen her was that her father, a cross old man, had begun
to sell his fruit on the bank of the river, and now made
her sit by it from morning till night.</p>

<p>One day it was very hot, and the sun was so fierce that
she grew sleepy and laid herself down under a palm tree
to rest. While she slept a string of camels came by,
and one of them knocked its foot against the pile of fruit;
with a great splash all the melons rolled, one over the
other, like round balls, down the bank, and were carried
away by the running water. The girl jumped up,
wringing her hands, and calling to the camel-drivers to
save them, but they only laughed and passed on. “Who
sleeps long at noon weeps long at night!” they shouted.</p>

<p>The poor girl did not wait till night, but sat down
at once in the dust and cried. When she looked up
she saw her father coming along on his donkey, for he
had been to admire his melon beds on the river-bank
some way off. She was so frightened that she began
running away as fast as she could.</p>

<p>She ran and ran till she came to a great wall in which
a door was standing open. Through it she went and
found herself in a fine garden full of jessamine and
orange trees. She was so tired that she looked about
for water to bathe her hot face, and a shady place
where she might rest and hide from the burning sun.
Not far off she could see the shine of a lake, and a
scarlet patch of high water plants in which a white
Pelican dozed, half asleep.</p>

<p>“By the beard of the Prophet!” exclaimed the
bird, “this is none other than the melon girl! O
Master! Master! Would I could see your yellow
kaftan approaching through the trees!”</p>

<p>But it was only Thursday, and there was no chance
of the young man coming till the morrow.</p>

<p>When the girl had bathed her face and drunk some
water he came forward, and, with much politeness,
invited her to rest among the tall cannas, as the scarlet
flowers were called. When he had heard her story
his face grew subtle.</p>

<p>“If you are wise,” said he, “you will remain with
me till to-morrow afternoon. To-day your father’s
anger will not have cooled; in the morning he will go
to the mosque (for it is Friday) and, when he has
prayed, his heart will be softened. Then you can
return in the afternoon and ask his forgiveness for
losing the melons.”</p>

<p>This the Pelican said because he knew that the
young man in yellow would come on the following
day.</p>

<p>“But I have no food,” said the girl; “I shall be
half-famished by to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Are there not fruits in the garden?” asked the
Pelican, “and have I not a bill a yard long? Lie
down and rest and I will see that you do not starve.”</p>

<p>He gazed at her as she slept and saw that she was
very beautiful. Her eyelashes were longer than a
finger’s breadth, and her mouth scarlet like the canna-flowers
over her head. When the evening was come,
he went out and took as much fruit as he could get
and brought it back in his pouch, washing it and giving
it to the girl, who ate thankfully. Then the stars
came out and they slept side by side among the
cannas.</p>

<p>Next day, at the hour when he expected his friend,
the bird went to the gate and stood watching. When
he saw him approaching he went forward crying, “See
what I have done for you! I have here got the melon
girl for whom you spend your life in searching. Come
in, and I will bring you to her.”</p>

<p>At this the young man was overjoyed and embraced
the Pelican, and the two hurried into the garden.</p>

<p>At sight of the girl he fell more deeply in love
than ever, and all the time he had meant to spend with
his friend he sat with her by the water. The Pelican
stood by. “See,” said he, “he has forgotten my very
existence, though he has come all the way from the
city for my company.”</p>

<p>But he understood too much to be angry, for he
knew such things had been since the foundation of the
world.</p>

<p>When the young man found that the girl was afraid
to go back to her father, he saw a way by which he
need not part with her. “Return with me,” said he,
“my mother is old and lives with me; you shall wait
upon her and cook the food for my house.”</p>

<p>So he took her back with him and presented her to
his mother.</p>

<p>Now the young man’s mother was a jealous woman,
and, though she liked the girl and was well pleased to
have her work done for her, she soon began to do
everything she could think of to make her miserable,
because she saw that her son loved her. So unhappy
did she make the household that the young man said,
“I must go immediately and consult the Pelican, or
there is no knowing what may happen.”</p>

<p>And, although it was not Friday, he went off to
Prince Hassan’s garden and laid his difficulties before
the bird.</p>

<p>“There is only one thing to be done,” said the
Pelican; “I must come back to keep the peace.”</p>

<p>Now, wise as he was, he did not know that, where
there is a jealous woman, not the Prophet himself and
all the Khalifas can save a household. All the
difference his coming made was that the old woman
was jealous of two people instead of one, and there
was no peace from morning till night.</p>

<p>It chanced, one day, that the young man had gone
out and the Pelican was near the fountain. In a top
room the girl sat at a window, looking down on the
street where the merchants were lighting their lamps.
The afterglow spread high over the roofs, and, in a
patch of sky, she saw the evening star rising behind the
mosque. She could hear the old woman’s voice talking
to a butcher in front of the shop. “At noon my son
will be out,” she was saying. “You must then come
with your knife and slay the Pelican who lives in the
courtyard. I will afterwards wash the blood from the
stones and tell him that the impious and deceitful
bird has flown away.”</p>

<p>Next morning the girl rose before anyone was
stirring and hired an ass. “Come,” she said to the
Pelican, “if you want to save your life, come with me.
The old woman has hired the butcher, and, when the
lord of this house has gone out, he is to come and kill
you. Mount quickly in front of me and I will carry
you through the town under my veil. When we get
to the river you shall fly to Prince Hassan’s garden,
and I will return before any one awakes and tell her
that you have died in the night, and that I have buried
you near the fountain. I will make a little mound
beside it.”</p>

<p>“Alack! Alack! I shall never see my master again!”
cried the Pelican.</p>

<p>“I will tell him the truth privately,” said she, “and
on Friday he will go to see you as before.”</p>

<p>So the two fled before the cocks crowed.</p>

<p>When they reached the banks of the Nile the
Pelican flew away across the bridge to the garden, and
the girl turned about and set her face to the city.</p>

<p>But, before she had gone ten yards, a hand was laid
on her, for her father had seen her ride by from his
boat. He dragged her on board, beating her, and took
her away to his melon beds on the river-bank where he
set her to drive the ox that worked the well.</p>

<p>When the young man in yellow rose and found that
his friend and the melon girl had both disappeared, he
made a great to-do and caused the bazaar to be searched
from end to end. Criers went about describing them
and calling on all who might have seen them to bring
news to the jeweller’s shop, where they would be
rewarded handsomely. But no one had seen them
pass. The mother was as much astonished as anybody.</p>

<p>“Son,” she said, “no doubt the Pelican, in his
wonderful wisdom, will return, and certainly, no one
will run away with that ugly slut of a girl. She will
come back fast enough.”</p>

<p>But the young man would not be comforted. He
bethought him of Prince Hassan’s garden, and, next
day, he set out to see if haply the bird had gone back
to the scarlet cannas and the fresh grass growing by
the lakes. He had no sooner entered than he saw him
in his accustomed place.</p>

<p>“Friend!” he cried, “this is a sorry trick you
have played me! My heart has despaired, and the
voice of the crier, searching the bazaar with beat of
drum, has not ceased since yesterday morning!”</p>

<p>“One day longer and he would have found my skin
in the butcher’s shop,” replied the Pelican. And he
related everything that had happened.</p>

<p>The young man was so enraged at what he heard
that he beat the grass with his staff till the sods flew.
“When I get home,” said he, “I will hire a house
in a different street for my mother, and she shall abide
there; and when I meet the butcher, I will make
every bone in his body ache.”</p>

<p>“That is right,” said the Pelican, enjoying the
thought.</p>

<p>“It is; and I will do it,” said the young man;
“but oh! where is the beautiful one? Her eyes
were like stars shining on the Nile, and her mouth
like the canna-flowers. When she walked, her passing
was as the wind in the lebbek-tree, and when she
drew her veil across her face, it was as though a trail
of river-mist crossed the moon.”</p>

<p>And he wept bitterly, making many holy vows that,
when he had found her, he would marry her, taking
none other to wife. The Pelican was much moved.</p>

<p>“Through silence everything is heard,” said he, “and
by waiting everything is attained. May the young
Pelicans laugh at my pouch if I do not find her for you
yet again.”</p>

<p>Now it chanced, very soon, that Prince Hassan, with
all the beauties of his harem, returned to the palace
which had stood empty more than a year. Among
the ladies was one who surpassed all the others,
and with whom Prince Hassan was deeply in love.
One day, while walking in the garden, she fell into
conversation with the Pelican, becoming so much
charmed with his polite manners and sentiments that
she would spend some time daily in his company.</p>

<p>“My lord,” she said to Prince Hassan, “I beg of
you to come with me into the garden and divert yourself
with the conversation of the Pelican who lives
there. He is the most wonderful bird, and he assures
me that he knows the whole of the Koran by heart.”</p>

<p>When the Prince was made acquainted with the
bird he commended the lady’s wit in discovering such
a companion, and he gave orders that nothing he
desired should be denied him. But, in spite of the
honour paid him, the Pelican never ceased to think of
the young man in yellow and the melon girl, and to
wonder how he could bring them together.</p>

<p>“Lady,” he said one day, “it is long since I looked
upon the world. When you are carried abroad in your
litter by the banks of the Nile I have a desire to go
with you. While you remain inside, veiled, I can put
my head through the curtains and see something of
the river-life I once knew. If you will allow this my
gratitude will not die while I breathe.”</p>

<p>The lady laughed heartily at the strange request, but
she did not refuse it, thinking of the Prince’s orders;
and, one evening, when the sun was low behind the
Pyramids, she set forth in her gilded litter with the
Pelican beside her.</p>

<p>While they went along the Nile bank they passed
many places where melons were sold, and at last he
saw the girl he sought beside a cloth spread on the
ground and full of fruit. As the litter passed he
stretched out his neck and cried: “The Sheikh’s tomb
by the Nile! The Sheikh’s tomb by the Nile!”</p>

<p>She jumped up and would have approached the
litter, but the slaves surrounding it pushed her away.</p>

<p>“Full moon!” cried the Pelican. “The Sheikh’s
tomb by the Nile at full moon!”</p>

<p>Next day, when the lady came out to talk to the
Pelican, he made a new request.</p>

<p>“Lady,” said he, “if you will make me your debtor
once more, you will grant me another wish. Send a
slave to the young man in the yellow kaftan who keeps
a jeweller’s shop in the street of Selim Baba’s Mosque
to tell him to go to the Sheikh’s tomb by the Nile at
full moon.”</p>

<p>The lady marvelled, for she had fallen asleep in the
litter, and had not heard the words he had cried to the
girl.</p>

<p>“I will do what you please,” she said, “but, first,
tell me who is the young man in the yellow
kaftan?”</p>

<p>Then the Pelican began to describe his friend in
such terms that the lady was filled with admiration, and
calling a black slave, sent him immediately to the city.
All that night she could not sleep for thinking of the
young man in yellow, and, on the evening of full
moon, she determined to see him for herself. So she
bribed a servant to bring her the blue gown and black
veil of a peasant woman, and, having dressed herself in
them, she hid her own clothes in the jessamine-arbour
in the garden and slipped out by a little hidden gate in
the wall.</p>

<p>Now the black slave whom she had sent with the
message was full of greed and cunning, so he went
straight to the Prince on his return and said, “My
lord, give me money, for I have discovered an infamous
plot.”</p>

<p>And he told him how the lady had summoned a
young man from the bazaar to meet her, at full moon,
at the Sheikh’s tomb by the Nile. Prince Hassan
was filled with rage, for in Egypt it is not the custom
that ladies go alone to meet strange young men; and
he also dressed himself and mounted his horse to ride
to the tomb, having wrapped himself in a cloak that
none might know him. The only person who was not
on the road, journeying to the spot, was the Pelican.</p>

<p>The first to arrive at the tomb was the young man
in yellow; his heart glowed, for he knew that the
Pelican had sent the message and guessed that the wise
bird had made this plan that he might meet his love.
So he sat down to wait under the palm-trees and
listened to the creak of the well-wheels in the fields.
Presently he heard a footstep and saw a woman come
gliding between the stems, but as he rushed forward to
embrace her, he perceived that it was not the melon girl
but a stranger.</p>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/142.jpg' alt='couple embracing' id='iid-0013' style='width:80%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<p>“What are you doing here?” he cried, in wrath at
his disappointment. “Off with you, or I will throw
you into the river!”</p>

<p>The lady, who had hoped that her beauty would
have made him fall in love with her on the spot, was
terrified and ran away; but when she had gone a few
yards, curiosity overcame her and she turned back,
unnoticed by the young man, and slipped behind the
tomb.</p>

<p>He sat waiting till he saw the melon girl approaching
softly like a shadow in the moonlight; then he
ran forward and held her in his arms, kissing her and
praising the Pelican who had brought them together.</p>

<p>While they sat under the palm-trees thus happily
employed, a sound of galloping hoofs drew near, and
Prince Hassan, in his dark cloak, rode into the palm
grove, and, drawing his sword, rushed upon them. But,
when he found the melon girl and not the lady he
expected, he stood still.</p>

<p>“Where is the lady who was to come here at full
moon?” he cried.</p>

<p>“Sir, there is no such person,” replied the young
man. “A peasant woman came by not long ago, but
she has gone into the fields.”</p>

<p>At the sound of Prince Hassan’s voice the lady behind
the tomb nearly died of terror, for she knew
that if he caught her he would certainly cut off her
head. So she slipped away and ran to the river-bank
while the Prince remained behind, questioning the
lovers, and it chanced that the first person she met was
a man on a trotting camel.</p>

<p>“If you will take me as fast as you can to the wall
of Prince Hassan’s garden,” she said, “I will give you
as much money as will make you rich for the rest of
your life.”</p>

<p>The camel-driver asked nothing better, so he took
the lady up behind him and went like a flash of lightning
to the place to which she directed him.</p>

<p>Then, having asked his name, she entered by the
little door in the wall and went to the jessamine-arbour,
where she put on her own clothes, hid the others, and
sat cooling herself in the night air and thanking heaven
which had protected her.</p>

<p>In a short time Prince Hassan came riding back and
entered the palace, calling her loudly.</p>

<p>“She is not here,” said the slaves, “we do not know
where she has gone.”</p>

<p>Then the Prince ran, raging and stamping, into the
garden, and as he passed the arbour, the lady called him
softly.</p>

<p>“Where have you been all this time, my lord?” she
cried. “It is but dull work sitting alone thinking of
you as the stars wane and you do not come. Alas!
what a hard fate it is to have a cold-hearted lover!”</p>

<p>Then the Prince, who was so much relieved in his
mind that he could almost have cried, rushed into the
arbour and embraced the lady, vowing that he would
never leave her again for so much as an hour. The
Pelican looked on from his canna-flowers by the lake.
Wise as he was, he did not understand what was
happening, for the subtlety of woman was a thing too
great even for him.</p>

<p>And the young man in yellow took the girl home
and married her next day; and when he grew rich,
which he soon did, he built a house by the Nile and
raised a fine garden of oranges and pomegranates. In
it the Pelican lived to a ripe old age, sustaining the
household by his wisdom, and standing sponsor to the
children.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='146' id='Page_146'></span><h1>THE CHERRY TREES</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>T</span>here</span> were once two little boys who played
in the great gardens of a palace; one was the
son of the King to whom the palace belonged,
and one was the son of the King’s head gardener.
The palace lay at the mouth of a valley, and the
garden had a stone balustrade surrounding it on
which the two would sit when they were tired
of their play. They were both of the same age,
and, as the Prince had neither brothers nor
sisters, the gardener’s son was allowed to come
every day and keep him company. They
learned the same lessons and amused themselves
with the same games; and, at nightfall, the
gardener’s boy would go back to his father’s cottage to
return early next morning. The gardener was a wise
man, and brought him up very well, but the King was
foolish and spoilt the Prince most dreadfully, which
was all the worse, as he was selfish and rude by nature,
and sometimes very unkind to his friend. But his
friend loved him dearly in spite of that.</p>

</div>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<p>The King lived all the year in this palace, although
he had another fine house in his capital city; for he
hated business, and liked the idle life he led with his
Queen and all the beautiful ladies and gentlemen who
formed his court. He never troubled himself about
anything; he did not even hunt, nor fish, but sat the
whole day listening to the gossip of his fools and
jesters, and writing very silly poetry. Then he would
read it aloud to all the beautiful ladies and gentlemen,
who threw up their hands and said: “How clever!”
But behind his back they laughed at him.</p>

<p>One day, when the little boys were playing, the
head gardener came by and gave each of them a fine
branch of ripe cherries, so they stopped their games
and sat on the balustrade to eat the fruit.</p>

<p>Suddenly a poor old beggar man passed by outside
the garden and looked up at them; he was tattered
and torn and he had no shoes on his feet; his face
was lined with fatigue and misery.</p>

<p>“I am very hungry,” said the beggar, addressing the
Prince, “and I have got nothing to eat. Please, young
gentleman, get me something from the palace, for, if I
have to go any further without food, I am really afraid
I shall die.”</p>

<p>“What? <span class='it'>I</span> go in and fetch you things from the
palace? A pretty idea! I tell you I am the King’s
son. I never heard of such impudence.”</p>

<p>“You may be the King’s son,” said the poor old
man; “but I am starving, for all that.”</p>

<p>For answer the Prince leaned down and struck the
beggar with the end of his cherry-branch.</p>

<p>The gardener’s son had eaten every one of his
cherries but three, and he held them out to the old
man. “I have nothing else to give,” he said, “but
you may have these.”</p>

<p>The beggar ate all three cherries and laid the stones
in a row on the ground; he chose one, and, when he
had polished it on his ragged coat, he gave it back to
the gardener’s son.</p>

<p>“Take that,” he said, “and plant it in the earth
somewhere outside this garden. I will keep the other
two.”</p>

<p>Then he bade him good-day, taking no notice of the
Prince, and was soon out of sight.</p>

<p>When the boys grew into young men they still
remained friends; as they had been practically brought
up together, and had learned the same things, strangers
often took them for brothers, more especially as they
were not unlike in face. But the curious thing was,
that, when the strangers found out that one was the
King’s son and one the son of the head gardener, they
always took the gardener’s son for the Prince. It was
very awkward sometimes, and it used to make the
Prince rather cross.</p>

<p>As time went on the King did not grow any wiser;
he was very foolish and self-indulgent. He never
attended to his business, and let everything in the
kingdom get into a dreadful mess. At last his subjects
became so much disgusted that they broke into rebellion,
and rushed to the palace meaning to put an end to
him altogether. He had heard rumours of discontent,
but he did not mind them, and would not believe
people when they told him that his life was in danger;
so, one day, thousands of rebels came pouring down
the valley brandishing knives and spears and great
flaring torches, and set fire to his palace, murdered him
and the Queen, and took all the beautiful ladies and
gentlemen prisoner. Then they rushed about searching
for the Prince, but could not find him as he was
walking with his friend, the gardener’s son, in the park
which surrounded the palace garden. At last a dozen
men on horseback set off with their swords to look for
him, and saw the two young men strolling about together
some way off.</p>

<p>Now the cherry-stone which the beggar had given
the gardener’s son had been planted not far from the
spot on which they were standing when the rebels saw
them. It had grown into a magnificent tree, and, as it
was now springtime, every branch and twig was a mass
of blossom. The Prince and his companion heard
a great shouting, and, looking round, they saw the
palace in flames, and a number of horsemen bearing
down on them with drawn swords. As they were
standing unarmed in the midst of an open plain, they
knew the only thing they could do was to run to the
shelter of a wood in front of them, and try to escape
among the trees; so they set off as fast as they could go.
The horsemen redoubled their pace with loud shouts.</p>

<p>They were nearing the wood when the Prince, who
was in advance, tripped and fell just as they passed the
cherry-tree. He flung his arms round the trunk to
save himself, and the gardener’s son stopped running,
for he would not leave him alone to be killed. He
made a terribly fierce face and stood in front of his
friend with his fists clenched. Then a wonderful
thing happened.</p>

<p>The petals of the cherry-blossoms began to fall like
snow; hither and thither they went, blown by a wind
which had suddenly risen, and filling the air with a
whirl of blinding white. It was a storm of whiteness.
Soon they lay knee-deep for yards round the tree.
It was impossible to see a yard in front of one’s face,
and the horsemen galloped about this way and that,
bewildered by the showers of petals and calling one to
the other in great dismay.</p>

<p>The young men leaned close against the trunk,
listening to their cries. Suddenly the gardener’s son
put his finger on a little rough place in the bark and,
to his astonishment, something moved under his hand.
A door opened in the trunk. He went in, drawing
the Prince after him, and shut it behind them.</p>

<p>They were at the top of a narrow stair which
led far down to where a glimmer of light could be
seen below. They descended, one after the other,
and found themselves in a country they had never seen
before. They were standing by a winding stream that
ran between alders whose roots were almost in the
water; all along the bank was a perfect forest of
daffodils, golden and shining. Above, the sky was
primrose-yellow with sunset, and a little crescent moon
hung in mid-air. There was an island in the water,
and on it was sitting the most lovely pale Princess that
ever was seen, with a wreath of daffodils in her hair.
As they looked at her she waved her hand to them and
they both fell in love with her at once.</p>

<p>The Prince and the gardener’s son did not know
whether to take their way back again up the steps or
not, but, when they tried to do so, they found all trace
of them had disappeared; besides, they could not tear
themselves away from the Princess. She rose and
sprang over the little bit of stream that divided the
island from the bank and came to meet them. They
took off their caps and bowed to the ground.</p>

<p>When she heard how they had reached her country
she was much astonished, and invited them to go with
her to the palace of her uncle, which was not far off.
Her uncle was a King, and, as she had neither father
nor mother, he had taken her to live with him and his
Queen.</p>

<p>They arrived at the palace and the Princess presented
the two friends to her uncle, who asked them to stay
at the court as long as they pleased; the Prince was in
a very bad temper, for he thought that the Princess
seemed to like his companion better than himself.</p>

<p>“<span class='it'>I</span> will stay with great pleasure,” he said, “but this
fellow is only the son of my father’s gardener. He
ought to go to the kitchen.”</p>

<p>The King could hardly believe him.</p>

<p>“Is that true?” he asked the gardener’s son.</p>

<p>“It is, your Majesty,” said the young man.</p>

<p>So he was sent off to live with the servants, and the
only comfort he had was the thought that the Princess
looked sorry.</p>

<p>The Prince enjoyed himself very much in the palace,
but his pleasure was spoilt because the Princess did not
take much notice of him and seemed glad when she
saw the gardener’s son anywhere; she always stopped
and spoke kindly to him. This made him furious.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/152.jpg' alt='man bowing to a witch inside a hut' id='iid-0015' style='width:80%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<p>One day he went to the King and told him that his
former companion was a good-for-nothing fellow, and
that he had heard him trying to stir up mischief among
the palace servants, and he suggested that he should be
sent away and made to work for his living. So the
King told the Queen, and the Queen settled that he
should be apprenticed to a witch who lived not far off,
and who wanted a man to work in the garden and help
her to keep her magic books and tools in order. So the
gardener’s son went.</p>

<p>When the day came for him to go he took his little
bundle in his hand, looked up at the Princess’s window,
and set off for the witch’s hut, which lay in the cleft
of a hill. When he arrived there he saw, to his great
surprise, that a cherry-tree, just like the one in the
world he had left, was growing close to the door.</p>

<p>Inside the hut the witch was sitting by the fire; she
was the most horrid-looking old woman imaginable;
and her double chin hung down below the strings of
her cap. Beside her, on the hearth, sat a little half-starved
black cat with green eyes.</p>

<p>“I suppose you are the young man from the palace,”
said she.</p>

<p>“I am,” said the gardener’s son.</p>

<p>He then made a bow to the witch, and being very
well-mannered, he made a bow to the cat too.</p>

<p>“You needn’t do that,” said the witch. “I am
one thing but the cat is quite another. His name is
Sootface.”</p>

<p>“It’s not a very nice name,” said the cat, apologetically.</p>

<p>“And you are not a very nice cat,” said the witch;
“so it is all the more appropriate.”</p>

<p>The gardener’s son soon found out that the witch
was far from being a pleasant person. She was dreadfully
unkind to poor Sootface and would beat him
unmercifully, and much of his time was spent in trying
to defend him from her anger. Besides this, he
had to sweep the hut, carry water, dig in the garden,
prepare the horrid dishes which she liked to eat, and
take care of her magic instruments. As he was clever
he did his best to learn all the magic he could;
this he did by the cat’s advice. When the old woman
was out, Sootface would show him where her book of
magic was kept and they would take it out and read
it together. The cat admired him immensely.</p>

<p>One day the witch set off on a journey and Sootface
and the gardener’s son went out for a walk.
When they had gone some way they sat down by a
hill-side to rest, for the day was hot and they were glad
of the shade of a spreading tree which stood by the
path. In a few minutes they saw the beautiful
Princess who lived in the King’s palace approaching
them.</p>

<p>She looked very sad, but, when she saw the gardener’s
son, she smiled and sat down beside him under
the tree, telling him that she had run away from the
palace when no one was looking because she wanted
to consult the witch.</p>

<p>“But the witch is away from home,” said
he.</p>

<p>“Oh dear! oh dear! what <span class='it'>shall</span> I do?” cried the
Princess, wringing her hands.</p>

<p>Then she explained that her uncle the King wished
her to marry the Prince, but that she hated him, and
meant to ask the witch for some magic spell to help
her to escape from him. She wanted to go far away
to the country where her sister lived; for her sister
had married a great King and had a kingdom of her
own.</p>

<p>“And when will the witch come back?” she
asked.</p>

<p>“Not for six weeks,” said the gardener’s son.</p>

<p>The poor Princess began to cry, which made him
very sad, and Sootface mewed at the top of his voice
for sympathy.</p>

<p>“If you will stop crying,” said he, “I will go with
you on your journey and take care of you till you reach
the end of it.”</p>

<p>“And I will go too,” said Sootface.</p>

<p>Now the cat and the gardener’s son had brought out
the witch’s book of magic to study as they rested by
the wayside, and they determined to see if it would
give them any advice for the journey.</p>

<p>The cat placed the book open before them on the
grass and repeated a song he had heard the witch
sing:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;“Flames and salt,</p>
<p class='line0'>And queens and kings,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And monkeys’ tails,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And golden rings.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p>Then they all could see how the letters on the page
were jumping about, and how they were arranging
themselves into a verse. When the verse was made
they read it, and found that it told the gardener’s son
to go back to the witch’s hut before starting and cut a
stick from the cherry-tree; so he obeyed at once, and
presently returned with a good strong staff in his hand,
and at sunset they set off for the kingdom of the
Princess’s sister.</p>

<p>For some days they got on very well. Sootface
marched first, capering and dancing with delight at
having escaped from the cruel old witch; the gardener’s
son followed, his cherry-stick in his hand, and giving
his arm to the Princess when she was tired. But, as
they were on foot, their progress was very slow, and,
having very little money between them, they began to
wonder how they should get enough food for each day.
The gardener’s son and the Princess did not like begging,
so the cat ran forward to every village as they approached
it, and, with many a sad tale and wonderful
antic, asked alms from door to door. Sometimes he
said that his father had died and required decent
burial; sometimes that he was the eldest of fourteen
and was charged with the education of his brothers and
sisters, and he always managed to bring back a little
money from the charitably disposed persons whom he
met.</p>

<p>But, at last, they came to a part of the world where
everybody was mean and misers were found in
abundance; in one village twenty of them lived in a
row in the principal street. They would give Sootface
nothing and even leaned out of their windows to shake
their fists at him as he passed, and he returned empty-handed
to his friends. Finding that things had come
to such a pass, they opened the book of magic and
Sootface sat in front of it repeating his verse. When
he had done this the letters jumped about as before, and
soon there was quite a clear verse upon the page.
This is what it said:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>

<div class='stanza-outer'>

</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p>It happened that that night was the first night of the
new moon, so they took the cherry-stick into a field and
the gardener’s son tossed it high into the air. It fell a
little way off, and when they had run to the place
where it lay, Sootface began digging with his paws
underneath it. Soon he came upon something hard,
and, when they had taken it out of the hole, they
found a leather bag stuffed full of gold.</p>

<p>After this their troubles vanished, and they began to
live in a very grand manner; at each town through
which they passed they hired splendid lodgings and
gave largely to beggars, and instead of travelling afoot,
they bought two fine horses; Sootface sat on the
crupper behind the gardener’s son, bowing affably to the
people who passed. They bought some magnificent
new clothes—those they wore being nearly worn out—and
thus they proceeded till the next new moon, when
they again tossed up the cherry-stick and found another
bag of money.</p>

<p>In time they drew near their journey’s end and
approached the capital town in which the Princess’s
sister lived, and they halted and sent the cat before them
with a letter to the palace.</p>

<p>When Sootface arrived at the town he took some
gold, and, going into a shop, bought a feathered hat
and two yards of green satin ribbon with which he
ornamented his tail. He then went to an inn, where
he purchased a fine piebald horse with an embroidered
saddle, and, having thus prepared himself, galloped to
the palace. Everyone in the street turned round to
look at him, and all the little boys cried “Hooray!” as
he thundered by.</p>

<p>After he had presented his letter, the Princess’s
sister herself received him with much politeness, and a
messenger was sent with a great escort of carriages and
horsemen to bring the Princess into the city.</p>

</div>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<p>When she came all were charmed with her, and she
was asked to make her home at the court; and, as the
handsome appearance and fine manners of the gardener’s
son impressed everybody, he was immediately made
captain of the bodyguard and treated with every consideration.</p>

<p>For some time they lived happily, hunting and
dancing and feasting and enjoying themselves, and
all went well until one day who should arrive in great
pomp and style but the Prince from whom the Princess
had fled! He had discovered where she was and followed
her to her sister’s kingdom. When he saw the
gardener’s son at the head of the bodyguard he was
enraged beyond measure.</p>

<p>That night there was a banquet, to which all the
celebrated people in the kingdom were invited; if I
were to describe it, it would take pages. Everything
glittered with cloth of gold and silver and jewels. The
table was covered with golden dishes and lamps and
white roses, and the Princess was there looking more
lovely than anybody, with the Prince at her right hand
and the gardener’s son at her left.</p>

<p>In the very middle of the feast the Prince stood up
in his place calling on all to listen. Then, as silence
fell, he told how the Princess had been ordered by her
uncle, the King, to marry him, how she had refused and
run away, how the young man who had accompanied
her was the son of his father’s gardener, and how,
though he was such a low fellow, he ventured to be in
love with her; he demanded that the Princess should
be made to marry him the next day and the gardener’s
son punished. Then he sat down scowling and leaving
the Princess’s sister and the guests horrified.</p>

<p>“Can you wonder that the Princess ran away
from him?” said the cat, from the other end of the
table.</p>

<p>Everybody agreed with the cat, for they admired the
gardener’s son very much, and nobody liked the looks
of the Prince; but they did not dare to say anything.
That would never have done at all.</p>

<p>“What defence have you to make, sir?” roared the
Princess’s sister’s husband.</p>

<p>“None,” said the gardener’s son. “I love the Princess
and shall do so as long as I live.”</p>

<p>“<span class='it'>That</span> won’t be for long,” said the Princess’s sister.</p>

<p>Then the Princess threw her arms round the neck of
the gardener’s son and vowed that she loved him too, and
that nothing would induce her to marry such a hateful
person as the Prince.</p>

<p>All the banquet broke up in confusion, and everyone
rushed out of the hall except the cat, who waited to
conceal a carving-knife upon his person with which he
intended to murder the Prince. But the Prince, who
was a coward, had gone off to his room and locked
himself in when he saw the way in which some of the
guests looked at him.</p>

<p>Next day the gardener’s son was put in prison; the
Princess cried and Sootface tore his hair, but he had to
go. What was his astonishment, on arriving at the
prison door, to find that a cherry-tree was growing
beside it. He was taken up a winding stair and locked
into a cell with a tiny window protected by iron bars.
When he looked out he could see into the boughs of
the tree, and, above them, a new moon beginning to
shine in the sky as it drew towards evening.</p>

<p>When it was night the cat, who had hidden the
witch’s book of magic as soon as the gardener’s son
had gone to prison, took it under his arm, climbed into
the boughs of the cherry-tree, and began to try and
console his friend, who was looking out of the barred
window. He opened it, reciting his song:</p>

<p class='noindent'>And, by the faint light of the new moon, he saw the
letters jumping about till they made this verse:</p>

</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p>The cat ran as fast as he could to the house where
the gardener’s son had lived and got the cherry-stick;
he then took it to a quiet place and flung it up into the
air. When it came down he began scraping and
digging underneath it till he came upon a heavy key
made of iron.</p>

<p>As soon as the people in the palace were safely
asleep he unlocked the stable door with the master-key,
saddled three swift horses and tied them up in a thicket
a little way off. Having done this and also ascertained
that the jailers were sleeping, in the belief that it was
impossible for their prisoner to escape, he climbed the
cherry-tree again. He crept along a bough which
almost touched the barred window and handed the
key through the bars to the gardener’s son; then he
got into the palace and, stealing into the Princess’s
room, told her what he had done.</p>

<p>The Princess was in bed, but she rose, dressed herself,
and went out with the cat. When they reached the
thicket they found the gardener’s son, who had let
himself out with the iron key, and they mounted and
rode away as hard as they could go.</p>

<p>They got safely out of the kingdom after a few days’
riding, and, in the first city to which they came, the
lovers were married. The cat was best man, and a fine
figure he made; for, though he had not been able to
bring his feathered hat and green ribbons with him, he
bought a new one even grander than the first, and a
white rosette for his tail in honour of the wedding.</p>

<p>The gardener’s son became very rich by reason of
the cherry-stick, which brought him a bag of gold at
every new moon, and he built a castle for his wife and
a fine villa for the cat, with a fountain in the garden
which played tunes, and a vinery which was the envy of
the civilised world. He became very friendly with the
King of the country in which he settled, and, at his
death, inherited the kingdom. So the Princess became
a Queen after all.</p>

<p>His favourite amusement was to come jumping
down into some nice garden where the flowers
were still blooming at the end of the autumn and pinch
all their beautiful heads until they died. Sometimes,
too, he would pinch the birds’ toes, and sometimes, in
the winter, he was so cruel as to kill the poor little
things outright. He had a heart as hard as a stone, and
the more wickedness he could do, the better he was
pleased. The birds hated him, and the squirrels hated
him, and the gardeners hated him, and no wonder, too.</p>

<p>One day he sat on the moon in a very terrible
humour thinking of all the bad things he meant to do;
and he took a great jump and came down on a
weathercock which was fixed on the top of the larch-tree
near a big stone house standing in a garden.
Inside the house a little boy in his night-shirt stood at
a window; the curtains were closed behind him in the
warm room, but he had got out of bed to admire the
stars which were bright overhead. He saw Jack Frost
swinging about on the weathercock and he did not
know who he was.</p>

<p>“Nurse!” he cried, “come and look at the funny
little man who is sitting all by himself on the weathercock!”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” said the nurse. “How can a man sit
on the weathercock? Get back into bed this minute
or you will have a cold in the morning and I shall be
obliged to give you nasty medicine.”</p>

<p>“But come! come!” he cried again.</p>

<p>The nurse went to the window and looked out, and,
just as she did so, Jack Frost jumped off the weathercock
into a holly tree.</p>

<p>“There! did you see that?” shouted the little boy,
clapping his hands.</p>

<p>The nurse saw it very well but she could not account
for it, so she pretended it had not happened.</p>

<p>“Stuff!” she said; “it was only a bird flying.”</p>

<p>“But a bird hasn’t got a pointed cap, and a long beard,
and a coat with long tails!”</p>

<p>“If I said it was a bird you may depend I was
right,” said the nurse, pushing him back into bed rather
roughly. But she tucked him up well and gave him a
kiss, for she was a very kind person, really.</p>

<p>As Jack Frost sat in the holly tree, a robin who
happened to be awake came to get a few holly berries,
for they were beginning to turn red.</p>

<p>“What are you doing on the holly tree?” he asked
as he saw him.</p>

<p>“What’s that to you?” said Jack Frost, who had no
manners.</p>

<p>“I am sure he is up to some harm,” said the robin.
“I will just wait about and see.”</p>

<p>Jack Frost sat mumbling and laughing to himself;
what he really wanted to do was to go into the garden
and spoil the flowers.</p>

<p>Presently a squirrel who was out of bed late ran up
the trunk of the larch-tree close by; he flourished his
tail and stopped to look at Jack Frost.</p>

<p>“Good evening,” he said very civilly, for though he
did not like Jack Frost he knew how to behave.</p>

<p>For answer Jack Frost took out a fir-cone he had in
his pocket and threw it at the squirrel’s head.</p>

<p>“He has been badly brought up,” said the squirrel,
who had several children and was very particular about
their behaviour. Then he went and sat at the foot
of the tree to watch Jack Frost, for he knew he
was wicked, and he thought it better to keep his eye
on him.</p>

<p>All this time the horrid little man was looking at
the garden wall; he sat very still till he heard
“Tu-whoo! Tu-whoo!” close by, and saw a large,
soft-winged owl flitting among the branches.</p>

<p>“Tu-whoo! Jack Frost!” he cried, as he sat down
beside him. “How are you this evening?”</p>

<p>For answer Jack Frost kicked up his heels very
rudely in the owl’s face. The bird flew silently away,
but he did not go far; he knew Jack Frost was
up to no good, so he perched hard by and watched
him with his round, burning eyes.</p>

<p>When all was quiet again, Jack Frost went hopping
from tree to tree till he got close to the garden wall,
where he could see over into the flower-beds; he did not
know that the robin, the squirrel, and the owl were all
looking at him from the places in which they had
hidden themselves.</p>

<p>Such a lovely garden as it was! There were green
walks and hedges and borders of heliotrope and pansies;
and, all round the hedges, rows of dahlias and hollyhocks
stood like kings and queens, red, yellow, pink,
white, and gorgeous orange. When they saw the
little wicked man they were terrified, poor things, and
though they tried to look bold and stand up straight,
they knew in their hearts that he had come to kill
them.</p>

<p>Close by stood a cottage in which the gardener was
asleep in his bed, wearing a fine red nightcap with a
handsome tassel on the end of it. He was very kind
to the little boy who lived in the stone house, for he
had no children of his own, and he liked to take him
out and show him birds’ nests and flowers, and teach
him to dig and plant and water the garden.</p>

<p>In the middle of his sleep he was wakened by
hearing a strange noise outside. He sat up in bed.</p>

<p>“Tap, tap,” it went on.</p>

<p>“Who’s there?” cried the gardener, jumping out
of bed and opening the window.</p>

<p>The robin was on the window-sill, very much
excited and dancing about. “Please, sir,” said he,
“Jack Frost is sitting up in a tree close to the garden.”</p>

<p>“Thank you! Thank you!” said the gardener,
beginning to put on his trousers. “I’ll get up this
moment!”</p>

<p>He had just got them on when a loud scraping
began on the window-sill.</p>

<p>“Who’s there?” cried the gardener, again.</p>

<p>“Me!” said the squirrel; “quick! quick! Jack
Frost is sitting on the garden wall.”</p>

<p>“Thank you! Thank you!” said the gardener,
beginning to put on his boots.</p>

<p>In another moment there was a great cry outside.
“Tu-whoo! Tu-whoo!” and a great flapping of
wings.</p>

<p>“Come out! Come out!” screamed the owl.
“Jack Frost has jumped down into the garden.”</p>

<p>“Thank you! thank you!” cried the gardener,
catching up a big stick and running out of the
house.</p>

<p>Jack Frost was in a flower bed looking up into the
face of a beautiful pink hollyhock and thinking which
of its blossoms he would pinch first, when he heard a
loud shout and saw the gardener with his red nightcap
and his big stick coming in at the garden door. He
was most dreadfully frightened, and began to run with
all his might. The gardener was after him at once, so
he tried to reach the gooseberry bushes and hide himself
among them, hoping it would be too dark for anybody
to see him.</p>

<p>But the owl, who could see everything at night, flew
after him, calling out, “There goes Jack Frost among
the gooseberry bushes! There he is! This way!
This way!” So he found it impossible to hide himself.
It was a good thing for him that he could run much
faster than the gardener, because he was so thin and
had such long legs.</p>

<p>He ran and ran, and the gardener puffed and blew
and could not catch him, so at last he took up a flower
pot and threw it as hard as he could at Jack Frost. It
hit him in the very middle of the back and knocked
him flat on his face on the path. He tried to get
up, but the gardener got hold of him by the collar
and shook and beat him with his big stick till he
prayed for mercy. Then he took him by the ear and
dragged him out of the garden.</p>

<p>At last Jack Frost wriggled out of his grasp and ran
for his life; he dashed into the larch-tree and climbed
up the branches to the topmost bough where the
weathercock was. There was no moon for him to get
on to, for she had gone to bed and the sky was so high
that he could not jump up all the way at once, so he
was obliged to sit hidden in the tree until the next
night.</p>

<p>The next night was misty and the moon came only
occasionally out of the cloud. The little boy who
lived in the stone house got out of his bed again to see
her.</p>

<p>While he was looking, Jack Frost took a mighty leap
and sprang up right through the clouds.</p>

<p>“Look! Look!” cried the little boy, “there is the
funny man again!”</p>

<p>“It’s you who are funny,” said the nurse; and she
hurried him back into bed and gave him one of his
favourite toys to put under his pillow.</p>

<p>She knew nothing about little men who jumped
among the trees.</p>

<p>Jack Frost landed safely on the moon and then flew
high, high up. But he never came down into that
garden again.</p>
